			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a few friends that are looking for work right now who have asked me about my experiences finding a job in my career. This got me to thinking about my &#8220;process&#8221; for finding a job, and I started to document it (no surprise for those who know me at all). As a service to said friends (who are of course going to remain anonymous), and others who might be interested, here is my process:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">As most of you know, tomorrow Apple is going to make an announcement. How big or little this announcement is depends on who you listen to, but most people tend to agree that the meat of the show will be the unveiling of the much rumored Tablet.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">However, I&#8217;m wondering if it is going to be more than just a &#8220;tablet&#8221;.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">To me, a tablet, something between the iPhone and the MacBook just makes no sense to Apple. Sure, there&#8217;s lots of those already, and I&#8217;m sure some of them make money, but for Apple to get involved with it, there has to be a market. They just don&#8217;t go and create things willy-nilly and hope for the best. They KNOW (or think they know) that something is going to work before they share it with the rest of us.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">That means that this &#8220;tablet&#8221; is going to have to have some killer functionality to it in order to distinguish it from all the other ones already on the market.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Looking at the logo for the upcoming event (which I must admit I&#8217;m afraid to host here so I&#8217;ll link to it elsewhere and hope for the best), I think I have an idea of what it might be. You know me, I can&#8217;t not analyze something&#8230;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Looking at the shape of the logo, it appears to be in a tablet shape. Ok, that&#8217;s kind of a no brainer.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">It&#8217;s also covered with paint splotches. Colorful, isn&#8217;t it? But wait, these look&#8230;well purposeful.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Also note that said splotches are NOT finger paint. Which one would expect with a tablet &#8220;ad&#8221;.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">What this suggests to me is that this tablet is going to have an optical recognition software where you interact with the device by looking at certain parts of it.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Now, before you say I&#8217;m crazy, here&#8217;s my thinking.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I&#8217;m a User eXperience professional for a living. My job is to make software and websites that people can use easily, and enjoy using. A byproduct of this is that I look at an awful lot of heat maps, which are illustrations created by special cameras that track eye movement and mark on the page where people are looking. This helps us as UX Architects to determine where to put items on the page so people will find them.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Now, look at this heat map and go back and look at the &#8220;Latest Creation&#8221; ad. Looks kind of similar, doesn&#8217;t it? And notice where the largest splotch of paint is? Right on the Apple logo.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">So, I may be WAY off base here, but I think tomorrow we&#8217;re going to see the beginning of optical input computing on a large scale.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">We&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;m right.</div>

<p>We&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;m right. Check me tomorrow&#8230;</p>
<p>EDIT: 27 January 2010</p>
<p>Well, I was wrong. Too bad. I would have liked to see that. Regardless, I&#8217;ll still buy one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got my invite to Google Wave today and have been playing with it a bit. So far, I have to say, it&#8217;s cool. I don&#8217;t really know if it will &#8220;be the next email&#8221; or even the replacement for it, but I can see a use for it: the end of the endless thread of long emails.</p>
<p>In business, it&#8217;s pretty common for an email to get passed from person to person, add another person, put in some more information, pass it back to someone else, and repeat. This leads to a HUGE amount of information that you may or may not need to know, as you part of it may be at the beginning, or worse, tucked somewhere in the middle of the conversation. This is where Google Wave will excel.</p>
<p>The neat thing about the Wave is the ability to &#8220;step into&#8221; the conversation at any point and play it back. You can roll back the conversation to any point and see what happened, with who, and when.</p>
<p>So, overall, I think it&#8217;s going to be a good product. It&#8217;s still a little buggy (crashed a bit on me in Firefox, but not Chrome, go figure), but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re working on it en masse.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking to a friend of mine today I&#8217;ve not talked to in a long time and the subject of what I do came up. Now, after all these years, I&#8217;m used to having to explain what I do to people. It&#8217;s just a by-product of the profession. There&#8217;s lots of joke names for what I do, &#8220;Bubble/Line Coordinator&#8221; is one of my personal favorites, but my term of choice for what I do comes from one of my early mentors in the field: I make software applications (for the Web) that are powerful but easy to use.</p>
<p>It sounds simple, and sometimes it is, but most of the time it&#8217;s a deeply challenging, and therefore rewarding, thing to do.</p>
<p>My grandfather used to say &#8220;the first time you hit a golf ball correctly, you&#8217;ll be hooked on the game for life&#8221; (he was right, by the way). Working in User Experience is just like that. The first time you hear from a user &#8220;wow, that was so easy&#8221;, you&#8217;ll be hooked. It was like that for me.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t anything glamorous, just an updated setup process for an application to manage a Microsoft Exchange-based product that involved some pretty deep concepts (from MX Records to MobileMail and BlackBerry options). I worked on it for a long time, and finally came to a flow that I thought worked well. When it was tested on users it received high marks, and one of the comments was &#8220;wow, that was easy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sure, the design answered the requirements (and increased activations by over 60%, which looked good on my annual review), but what meant the most to me was that one user&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>That was my golf ball, and I hit it correctly. I&#8217;m hooked on Usability for life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I had an old laptop laying around. Well, to be fair, I have LOTS of old laptops laying around, I&#8217;m a tech packrat (there are two 20th century clamshell iBooks within 3 feet of me as I write this). However, this was a REALLY old laptop. It&#8217;s a Toshiba Satellite that is so old that it has a &#8220;Made for Windows98&#8243; sticker on it. I don&#8217;t know why I have had it laying around all this time, but as with many things, it came in handy today.</p>
<p>I was playing with a new custom ROM on my G1 and thought to myself, &#8220;hey, I bet I can get Android running on a PC&#8221;, and low and behold, I was right. Thanks to <a href="http://www.taranfx.com/blog/how-to-run-google-android-in-virtualbox-vmware-on-netbooks">this little article</a>,  I had it up and running in no time. The machine in question won&#8217;t boot via USB (no surprise there), but the CD image worked just fine and now I&#8217;m up and running (it also worked great in VMWare, for those of you adventurous types w/out an old laptop laying around).</p>
<p>More to come, but so far, so cool!</p>

Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I will make the final decision of what I want. Also, bring me the cost breakdown for each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one.&#8221;</p>
