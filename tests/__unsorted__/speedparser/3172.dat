  <description>Lines from this poem have been swimming through my head for a couple of days and I'd been wanting to read it again - but I've lent it to the one I'm making read it. &lt;br /&gt;So I turned to google and rather not keep it to myself.&lt;br /&gt;I can't read it out of context... without relating it to what it means in the novel, but maybe you who haven't read it can enjoy it in another way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you took advantage of a sinner&lt;br /&gt;because you took advantage &lt;br /&gt;because you took &lt;br /&gt;because you took advantage of my disadvantage&lt;br /&gt;when I stood Adam-naked&lt;br /&gt;before a federal law and all its stinging stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you took advantage of a sin&lt;br /&gt;when I was helpless moulting moist and tender&lt;br /&gt;hoping for the best&lt;br /&gt;dreaming of marriage in a mountain state&lt;br /&gt;aye of a litter of Lolitas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you took advantage of my inner&lt;br /&gt;essential innocence&lt;br /&gt;because you cheated me--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you cheated me of my redemption&lt;br /&gt;because you took&lt;br /&gt;her at the age when lads&lt;br /&gt;play with erector sets&lt;br /&gt;a little downy girl still wearing poppies&lt;br /&gt;still eating popcorn in the colored gloam&lt;br /&gt;where tawny Indians took paid croppers&lt;br /&gt;because you stole her&lt;br /&gt;from her wax-browed and dignified protector&lt;br /&gt;spitting into his heavy-lidded eye&lt;br /&gt;ripping his flavid toga and at dawn&lt;br /&gt;leaving the hog to roll upon his new discomfort&lt;br /&gt;the awfulness of love and violets&lt;br /&gt;remorse despair while you&lt;br /&gt;took a dull doll to pieces&lt;br /&gt;and threw its head away&lt;br /&gt;because of all you did&lt;br /&gt;because of all I did not&lt;br /&gt;you have to die&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death sentence written by Humbert Humbert for Clare Quilty to read before shooting him. &lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Lolita&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A man said to the universe: &lt;br /&gt;"Sir, I exist!" &lt;br /&gt;"However," replied the universe, &lt;br /&gt;"The fact has not created in me a sense of obligation.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Crane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/anm0rata/lj/exist.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name="cutid1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo is about 3 years old now... I remember posting it at &lt;span class='ljuser ljuser-name_si6nifi3r' lj:user='si6nifi3r' style='white-space:nowrap'&gt;&lt;a href='http://si6nifi3r.livejournal.com/profile'&gt;&lt;img src='http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://si6nifi3r.livejournal.com/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;si6nifi3r&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (or did I?) along with  a few other sand scribbles (an act that hypnotized me probably more than it should a regular person) that I watched waves wash away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't mention the references, but this one was somewhat recalling that poem.</description>

  <description>"There are gentle souls who would pronounce &lt;i&gt;Lolita&lt;/i&gt; meaningless because it does not teach them anything. I am neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction, and, despite John Ray's assertion, &lt;i&gt;Lolita&lt;/i&gt; has no moral in tow.&lt;br /&gt;For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm. There are not many such books." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It is childish to study a work of fiction in order to gain information about a country or about a social class or about the author. And yet one of my very few intimate friends, after reading &lt;i&gt;Lolita&lt;/i&gt;, was sincerely worries that I (I!) should be living "among such depressing people."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vladimir Nabokov &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;on a book entitled Lolita&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <title>some Genet</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/370540.html</link>
  <description>Again I'm obsessing over Jean Genet, but only when I'm not distracted by whatever else I'm reading at the moment &lt;br /&gt;(which I'll be sharing for sure. I intended to quit posting out of context quotes here as well... but I can't keep them to myself, and I'm sure some of you out there still enjoy them, or so I hope). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In absolute misery and confinement (emotional and physical), Genet mythifies his reality... transforming everything that is unpleasant, ugly, vile or disgusting into the opposite with precise, sincere&amp;nbsp;observations that are descriptions of beauty.&amp;nbsp;I don't think I've read anything in Genet about anything that is less than beautiful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should be going inside... new house, luxuries such as my computer desk steps away from my bed have been given up for... "civilization" (versus wilderness). If you want to stay up to date on that, add &lt;span class='ljuser ljuser-name_si6nifi3r' lj:user='si6nifi3r' style='white-space:nowrap'&gt;&lt;a href='http://si6nifi3r.livejournal.com/profile'&gt;&lt;img src='http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://si6nifi3r.livejournal.com/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;si6nifi3r&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, I'm keeping my life out of this one as much as I can. &lt;br /&gt;As you may have observed. &lt;br /&gt;More later.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Certain acts dazzle us and light up blurred surfaces, if our eyes are sharp enough to see them in a flash, for the beauty of a living thing can be grasped only fleetingly. To pursue it during its changes leads us inevitably to the moment when it ceases, for it cannot last a lifetime. And to analyze it, that is, to pursue it in time with the sight and the imagination, is to view it in its decline, for following the marvelous moment in which it reveals itself, it diminishes in intensity." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"... I remain disturbed in the presence of the person who revealed to me that beauty is the projection of ugliness and that by 'developing' certain monstrosities we obtain the purest ornaments." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A man must dream a long time in order to act with grandeur, and dreaming is nursed in darkness. Some men take pleasure in fantasies whose basic contents are not celestial delights. These are less radiant joys, the essence of which is evil." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"... who cares about the reasons for an attitude that composes a poem?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If we are free - available - and without faith, our aspirations escape from us, as light does from the sun, and, like light, can flee to infinity, for the physical or metaphysical sky is not a ceiling."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Faults sometimes - they are deeds - produce poetry." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Genet, from &lt;em&gt;Miracle of the Rose&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Hey, elljay. &lt;br /&gt;Please know you are always on my mind and in my heart, and that you are and will always be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lately I feel an overwhelming, pressing, mind-twisting dullness over me,&lt;br /&gt;mixed with anxiety, disappointment and frustration, &lt;br /&gt;so I'm keeping my thoughts, opinions and self to myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, &lt;br /&gt;a warning label to friends, lovers, haters (and others): &lt;br /&gt;I am being reclusive. And I miss you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a comfort poem to fill in some space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unrest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A fierce unrest seethes at the core	 &lt;br /&gt;    Of all existing things:	 &lt;br /&gt;It was the eager wish to soar	 &lt;br /&gt;    That gave the gods their wings.	 &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;From what flat wastes of cosmic slime,	         &lt;br /&gt;    And stung by what quick fire,	 &lt;br /&gt;Sunward the restless races climb!â”	 &lt;br /&gt;    Men risen out of mire!	 &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;There throbs through all the worlds that are	 &lt;br /&gt;    This heart-beat hot and strong,	  &lt;br /&gt;And shaken systems, star by star,	 &lt;br /&gt;    Awake and glow in song.	 &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;But for the urge of this unrest	 &lt;br /&gt;    These joyous spheres are mute;	 &lt;br /&gt;But for the rebel in his breast	  &lt;br /&gt;    Had man remained a brute.	 &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;When baffled lips demanded speech,	 &lt;br /&gt;    Speech trembled into birthâ”	 &lt;br /&gt;(One day the lyric word shall reach	 &lt;br /&gt;    From earth to laughing earth.)â”	  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;When man's dim eyes demanded light,	 &lt;br /&gt;    The light he sought was bornâ”	 &lt;br /&gt;His wish, a Titan, scaled the height	 &lt;br /&gt;    And flung him back the morn!	 &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;From deed to dream, from dream to deed,	  &lt;br /&gt;    From daring hope to hope,	 &lt;br /&gt;The restless wish, the instant need,	 &lt;br /&gt;    Still lashed him up the slope!	 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sing no governed firmament,	 &lt;br /&gt;    Cold, ordered, regularâ”	  &lt;br /&gt;I sing the stinging discontent	 &lt;br /&gt;    That leaps from star to star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Don Marquis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also.

  <description>Who am I? If this once I were it rely on a proverb, then perhaps everything would about to knowing whom I "haunt." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My image of the "ghost," including everything conventional about its appearance as well as its blind submission to certain contingencies of time and place, is particularly significant for me as the finite representation of a torment that may be eternal. Perhaps my life is nothing but an image of this kind; perhaps I am doomed to retrace my steps under the illusion that I am exploring, doomed to try and learn why I should simply recognize, learning a mere fraction of what I have forgotten. This sense of myself seems inadequate only insofar as it presupposes myself, arbitrarily preferring a completed image of my mind which need not be reconciled with time - an idea of irreparable loss, of punishment, of a fall whose lack of moral basis is, as I see it, indisputable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Nadja &lt;/em&gt;by André Breton. &lt;br /&gt;Best V-Day present &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <title>Orlando quotes</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/365920.html</link>
  <description>I finally finished Virginia Woolf's &lt;em&gt;Orlando&lt;/em&gt;, long after having received it as a birthday gift from &lt;span class='ljuser ljuser-name_losemeontheway' lj:user='losemeontheway' style='white-space:nowrap'&gt;&lt;a href='http://losemeontheway.livejournal.com/profile'&gt;&lt;img src='http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://losemeontheway.livejournal.com/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;losemeontheway&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; maybe two years ago. &lt;br /&gt;(Thanks again, Emily, you were right about everything. &lt;br /&gt;It is now on my top favorite books ever list.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a while since I transcribed quotes to lj... &lt;br /&gt;because I've been doing it on &lt;a href="http://n3cr0phelia.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tumblr&lt;/a&gt; instead, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn't forget, and here they are. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I felt the need to type whole passages, but refrained and just stuck to the ones that made the most sense out of context. Somewhat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span class="quote"&gt;No passion is stronger in the breast of man than the desire to make others believe as he believes. Nothing so cuts at the root of his happiness and fills him with rage as the sense that another rates low what he prizes high.&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span class="quote"&gt;It is all an illusion (which is nothing against it, for illusions are the most valuable and nacessary of all things, and she who can create one is among the world’s greatest benefactors), but as it is notorious that illusions are shattered by conflict with reality, so no real happiness, no real wit, no real profundity are tolerated where the illusion prevails.&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span class="quote"&gt;For if it is rash to walk into a lion’s den unarmed, rash to navigate the Atlantic in a rowing boat, rash to stand on one foot on the top of St. Paul’s, it is still more rash to go home alone with a poet. A poet is Atlantic and lion in one. While one drowns us, the other gnaws us. If we survive the teeth, we succumb to the waves. A man who can destroy illusions is both beast and flood. Illusions are to the soul what atmosphere is to the earth. Roll up that tender air and the plant dies, the colour fades. The earth we walk on is a parched cinder. It is marl we tread and fiery cobbles scorch our feet. By the truth we are undone. Life is a dream. ‘Tis waking that kills us. He who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life - (and so on for six pages if you will, but the style is tedious and may well be dropped).&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span class="quote"&gt;Her ankle was broken. She could not rise. But there she lay content. (…) ‘I have found my mate,’ she murmured. ‘It is the moor. I am nature’s bride,’ she whispered, giving herself in rapture to the cold embraces of the grass as she lay folded in her cloak in the hollow by the pool. ‘Here I will lie. (A feather fell upon her brow.) I have found a greener laurel than the bay. My forehead will be cool always. These are wild birds’ feathers - the owls, the nightjars. I shall dream wild dreams. My hands shall wear no wedding ring,’ she continued, slipping it from her finger. ‘The roots shall twine about them.’&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span class="quote"&gt;‘Madam,’ the man cried, leaping to the ground, ‘you’re hurt!’&lt;br /&gt;‘I’m dead, Sir!’ she replied. &lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, they were engaged."&lt;/span&gt;</description>

  <description>...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And should I then presume?&lt;br /&gt;And how should I begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I dare&lt;br /&gt;Disturb the universe?&lt;br /&gt;In a minute there is time&lt;br /&gt;For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible to say just what I mean!&lt;br /&gt;But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:&lt;br /&gt;Would it have been worth while&lt;br /&gt;If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,&lt;br /&gt;And turning toward the window, should say:&lt;br /&gt;“That is not it at all,&lt;br /&gt;That is not what I meant, at all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know this one.&lt;br /&gt;Or not.

  <title>[this is the way the...]</title>

  <description>You may not believe me,&lt;br /&gt;(though some who know [me] better might believe me)&lt;br /&gt;but as I'm reading through some texts for my American Transcendentalists final &lt;br /&gt;(Emmerson, particularly),&lt;br /&gt;at this moment (as I was typing it onto my lj client, because for me, I always feel something more when I write it... hence my compulsion to take notes rather than listen, my need to quote)&lt;br /&gt;I was moved (again) in such a way that feelings seep out of my body and I need to cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it may just be &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; vision of things... of the world and the present. &lt;br /&gt;But I'm reading Whitman's preface to &lt;i&gt;Leaves of Grass&lt;/i&gt; and some of Emmerson's essays... most, though universal about mankind, more specifically about the American "race."&lt;br /&gt;A very idealistic planning out of what it is to be, in my opinion, a &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt; human being. &lt;br /&gt;In touch with everyone and everything around them... the poet, according to Emmerson (and Whitman and lots of other poets before them) obviously being more in touch with the Universe and hence, the &lt;i&gt;seer&lt;/i&gt;, and the one who professes or expresses the beauty and truth of what he sees that most are unable to see. &lt;br /&gt;Because he cannot be the latter without being the first, yet he can be the first without being the last. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what these poets saw was mostly projections (real or possible) of beauty and perfection... and hope. &lt;br /&gt;Such hope, without a doubt, that humankind (Americans mostly) would become as what they projected in their poetry... just, courageous, free and trusting of themselves and others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So not&lt;/b&gt; what I perceive humankind to be...&lt;br /&gt;More like the fictional, ideal humankind... and the people I love and admire, but not people in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first read &lt;i&gt;The Oversoul&lt;/i&gt; when I was 16 (and those of you in my friends list here on lj back then surely witnessed what sprang forth from that - not that you'd remember, anyway...) for one of the first lit courses I took and couldn't remember what it was about, but what I felt.&lt;br /&gt;For some moments, I felt loved.&lt;br /&gt;I felt secure in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Oversoul&lt;/i&gt;  is a warm, fuzzy blanket to sink into on a cold night that makes everything be well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm reading it again, and I feel it again...&lt;br /&gt;It's still a warm fuzzy blanket that makes everything seem better... but I feel there's a hailstorm outside it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we, as the human race... as &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;... are so non-continual... so disjointed... so selfish and wrapped up in our individual selves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it's just my mood right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe it's just my lack of contemporary reading, but how is the poet regarded today, in a collective sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about my "specialty" again... I think one of the topics that I keep coming across over and over again throughout my studies (as a topic of personal interest) is the figure of the poet.&lt;br /&gt;Spanning from bits of classical to early 20th century. Western (blame the UPR). &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps because I relate to it... not in mastery, but sensibility. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've read &lt;i&gt;Song of Myself&lt;/i&gt; a few times before... maybe it was because I read Emmerson as a starter, but tonight (and not before) it seems absolutely effer&lt;i&gt;vesc&lt;/i&gt;ent to me.&lt;br /&gt;I literally felt it bubbling on my skin because it's &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; uplifting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think of it in terms of history... and nationality... and see this American&lt;i&gt;ism&lt;/i&gt; twisted out of context and made into something else. &lt;br /&gt;It is liberating to feel invincible, limitless... even if just spiritually. And ideally.&lt;br /&gt;But reading into the past, this projected Utopian dream... makes me be a little disappointed in the present.&lt;br /&gt;Because I do not trust my "brothers and sisters" and have reasons not to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitman writes, "Men and women and the earth and all upon it are simply to be taken as they are, and the investigation of their past and present and future shall be unintermitted and shall be done with perfect candor. Upon this basis philosophy speculates ever looking toward the poet, ever regarding the eternal tendencies of all toward happiness never inconsistent with what is clear to the senses and to the soul." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if we speculate looking towards the poet... and regard the eternal tendencies of all toward happiness never inconsistent with what is clear to the senses and to the soul... it makes me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes after?&lt;br /&gt;A Wasteland (to use one example). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize how I feel, I'll contrast this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of divine energy. Words are also actions, actions are a kind of words. " &lt;br /&gt;- Emmerson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Between the idea&lt;br /&gt;And the reality&lt;br /&gt;Between the motion&lt;br /&gt;And the act&lt;br /&gt;Falls the Shadow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                     For Thine is the Kingdom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Thine is&lt;br /&gt;Life is&lt;br /&gt;For Thine is the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the way the world ends&lt;br /&gt;This is the way the world ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is the way the world ends&lt;br /&gt;Not with a bang but a whimper&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- T.S. Eliot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Quite the premature buzzkill, I know. Sorry.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My paper is about none of this, I just wasted like 40 minutes thinking and writing about it, and it's 3 am, so I better get back to work.&lt;br /&gt;Or take a nap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some quotes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The man is only half himself, the other half is his expression."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"...poetry was all written before time was."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"... though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency, because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer. (...) Language is fossil poetry." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Milton says, that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but the epic poet, he who shall sing of the gods, and their descent unto men, must drink water out of a wooden bowl."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Always our being is descending into us from we know not whence."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We live succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime, within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every particle is equally related; the eternal ONE."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The sign and credentials of the poet are, that he announces that which no man foretold."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ralph Waldo Emmerson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius. The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and perfect as the greatest artist…  " &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into any thing that was before thought small it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe. He is a seer... he is complete in himself... the others are as good as he, only he sees it and the do not. He is not one of the chorus he does not stop for any regulation... he is the president of regulation."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The known universe has one complete lover and that is the greatest poet. He consumes an eternal passion and is indifferent which chance happens and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune persuades daily and hourly his delicious pay.&lt;br /&gt;His love above all love has leisure and expanse... he leaves room ahead of himself. He is no irresolute or suspicious lover... he is sure... he scorns intervals. His experience and the showers and thrills are not or nothing. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing can jar him... suffering and darkness cannot - death and fear cannot. To him complaint and jealousy and envy are corpses buried and rotten in the earth... he saw them buried. The sea is not surer of the shore or the shore surer of the shore of the sea than he is of the fruition of his love and of all perfection and beauty." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A great poem is no finish to a man or woman but rather a beginning." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I help myself to material and immaterial, &lt;br /&gt;No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,&lt;br /&gt;And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,&lt;br /&gt;Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walt Whitman</description>

  <title>Moby Dick quotes</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/355982.html</link>
  <description>"... Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.&lt;br /&gt;Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.&lt;br /&gt;Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.&lt;br /&gt;In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ishmael&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"...you were kicked by a great man, and with an ivory leg, Stubb. It's an honour, I consider it an honour. &lt;br /&gt;In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, a made garter-knights of; but, be it YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Perhaps they were (whales as scarce as hen's teeth);  &lt;br /&gt;or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; &lt;br /&gt;takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; &lt;br /&gt;every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. &lt;br /&gt;In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship; &lt;br /&gt;by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. &lt;br /&gt;But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror.  &lt;br /&gt;Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for ever.  &lt;br /&gt;Heed it well, ye Pantheists" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ishmael&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name="cutid1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://thenot.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/moby_dick_1.jpg"&gt;</description>

  <title>nausea</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/354039.html</link>
  <description>I try to keep it secret when I'm reading something not related to what I &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be reading (even from myself),&lt;br /&gt;as if I were cheating on &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; subject(s) still. &lt;br /&gt;But I've found that this guilt complex is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm slowly getting the books I requested at &lt;a href="http://www.paperbackswap" rel="nofollow"&gt;paperbackswap&lt;/a&gt; in the mail, among which is Sartre's &lt;i&gt;Nausea&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introduction is also a brief introduction to existentialism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class='ljuser ljuser-name_viktor_exhumed' lj:user='viktor_exhumed' style='white-space:nowrap'&gt;&lt;a href='http://viktor-exhumed.livejournal.com/profile'&gt;&lt;img src='http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://viktor-exhumed.livejournal.com/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;viktor_exhumed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gave a report for his thesis workshop a few weeks ago on a poem (that I absolutely don't remember, and didn't read through the whole thing) where I kind of recall that he reached some conclusions about the poet  that were from a somewhat existentialist point of view. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was telling him about it yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;I'm posting some quotes here. &lt;br /&gt;You know. To share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaspers has written: "The non-rational is found in the opacity of the here and now... in the actual empirical existence which is just as it is and not otherwise." Why is it not otherwise? Why &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; it at all? What is this is-ness? Isn't it simply nothing, or rather Nothingness, the unknowable, indispensable Void? What could be more absurd, "non-rational," meaningless? The mind of man, which he did not ask to be given, demands a reason and a meaning - this is its self-defining cause - and yet it finds itself in the midst of a radically meaningless existence. The result: impasse. And nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, beginning in the loathsome emptiness of his existence, creates his essense - his self, his being - through choices that he freely makes. Hence his being is never fixed. He is always becoming, and if it were not for the contingency of death, he would never end. Nor would philosophy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the introduction by Hayden Carruth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some nauseous quotes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is what I have to avoid, I must not put strangeness where there is none. &lt;b&gt;I think that is the big danger in keeping a diary: you exaggerate everything.&lt;/b&gt; You continually force the truth because you're always looking for something."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Perhaps it was a passing moment of madness after all. There is no trace of it anymore. My odd feelings of the other week seem ridiculous today. I can no longer enter into them." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this also speaks for the blogger generation.&lt;br /&gt;More later. (Or not really.)</description>

  <title>sleepy hollow quote</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/349121.html</link>
  <description>Reading &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&lt;/i&gt; for Sharp's class tomorrow. &lt;br /&gt;Actually, no.&lt;br /&gt;I'm listening to a download from &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; (heads up, Mari. And possibly, Viktor. The rest of you, don't ask.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of it is caricaturesque description (and narration, too) but this is cute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero."</description>

  <description>I'm cleaning up my myspace blog because... &lt;br /&gt;because. &lt;br /&gt;I don't know why I used to write in it the first place, probably reaching out for... anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I transcribed this poem from Niel Gaiman's &lt;i&gt;Fragile Things&lt;/i&gt; long ago and posted it.&lt;br /&gt;I googled it, it's not online.&lt;br /&gt;So if you don't own the book, here's a freebie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Faerie Reel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were young as I once was, and dreams&lt;br /&gt;and death more distant then,&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't split my soul in two, and keep&lt;br /&gt;half in the world of men, &lt;br /&gt;So half of me would stay at home, and&lt;br /&gt;strive for Faerie in vain,&lt;br /&gt;While all the while my soul would stroll up&lt;br /&gt;narrow path, down crooked lane,&lt;br /&gt;And there would meet a fairy lass and&lt;br /&gt;smile and bow with kisses three,&lt;br /&gt;She'd pluck wild eagles from the air and&lt;br /&gt;nail me to a lightning tree&lt;br /&gt;And if my heart would run from her or&lt;br /&gt;flee from her, be gone from her,&lt;br /&gt;She'd wrap it in a nest of stars and then&lt;br /&gt;she'd take it on with her&lt;br /&gt;Until one day she'd tire of it, all bored&lt;br /&gt;with it and done with it&lt;br /&gt;She''d leave it by a burning brook, and off&lt;br /&gt;brown boys would run with it and&lt;br /&gt;stretch it long and cruel and thin,&lt;br /&gt;They'd slice it into four and then they'd&lt;br /&gt;string with it a violin.&lt;br /&gt;And every day and every night they'd&lt;br /&gt;play upon my heart a song&lt;br /&gt;So plaintative and so wild and strange that&lt;br /&gt;all who heard it danced along&lt;br /&gt;And sang and whirled and sank and trod and&lt;br /&gt;skipped and slipped and reeled and rolled&lt;br /&gt;Until, with eyes as bright as coals, they'd&lt;br /&gt;crumble into wheels of gold....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am young no longer now; for&lt;br /&gt;sixty years my heart's been gone&lt;br /&gt;To play this dreadful music there, beyond&lt;br /&gt;the valley of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I watch with envious eyes and mind, the&lt;br /&gt;single-souled, who dare not feel&lt;br /&gt;The wind that blows beyond the moon,&lt;br /&gt;who do not hear the Fairy Reel.&lt;br /&gt;If you don't hear the Fairy Reel, they will&lt;br /&gt;not pause to steal your breath.&lt;br /&gt;When I was young I was a fool. So wrap&lt;br /&gt;me up in dreams and death.</description>

  <description>"In reality, every reader is, while he is reading, the reader of his own self. The writer's work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers to the reader to enable him to discern what, without the book, he would perhaps never have perceived in himself." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcel Proust, &lt;i&gt;The Past Recaptured&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from &lt;i&gt;Autobiography: Toward a Poetics of Experience&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <title>book quote [of the... week?]</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/335403.html</link>
  <description>The critic lives at second hand. He writes &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt;. The poem, the novel, or the play must be give to him; &lt;font color="red"&gt;criticism exists by the grace of other men's genius.&lt;/font&gt; (...)&lt;br /&gt;The true critic is servant to the poet; today he is acting as master, or being taken as such. He omits Zarathustra's last, most vital lesson: "now, do without me." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that great discourse with the living dead which we call reading, our role is not a passive one. Where it is more than reverie or an indifferent appetite sprung of boredom, reading is a mode of action. We engage in the presence, the voice of the book. We allow it entry, though not unguarded, into our inmost. A great poem, a classic novel, press in upon us; they assail and occupy the strong places of our consciousness. The exercise upon our imagination and desires, upon our ambitions and most covert dreams, a strange, bruising mastery. &lt;b&gt;Men who burn books know what they are doing. &lt;/b&gt; The artist is the uncontrollable force: no Western eye, since Van Gogh, looks on a cypress without observing in it the start of flame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Steiner, "Humane Literacy." &lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Language and Silence&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <title>undead, undead</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/323327.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bauhaus&lt;/i&gt;, among the post-Punk bands associated with the inception of 'Goth' musical and sartorial styles in the late 1970s in Britain did not celebrate Dracula in their first single, but the actor: 'Bela Lugosi is Dead' and, of course, &lt;b&gt;undead&lt;/b&gt; as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Gothic&lt;/i&gt; by Fred Botting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is about the history, development and some analyses of Gothic Literature. &lt;br /&gt;So... that mention was unexpected, unnecessary, and &lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <title>Paul Auster quote</title>
  <link>http://n3cr0phelia.livejournal.com/314874.html</link>
  <description>In one of his books, Auster quotes the psychiatrist Oliver Sachs's belief that it is a sign of sanity to make an internal narrative of your life. Indeed, as Auster knows, although he has never been in therapy himself, the construction or reconstruction of such a narrative is the premise of psychoanalytic healing. When a writer makes up fictional narratives, is that also a sign of psychic health, I ask. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I doubt it. I think writers are probably a little damaged. For artists of any kind I suppose, but particularly for people who make up stories, reality isn’t enough. You need to interpret reality; you need to make your own reality. I really admire people who are content to be in the world as it is and find that enough. But it’s not enough for writers. Something is wrong with us I believe."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More later. Maybe.</description>

  <title>quotes for today</title>

  <description>My favorite &lt;a href="http://interglacial.com/~sburke/pub/prose/Blake_-_Proverbs_of_Hell.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Proverbs of Hell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;from &lt;i&gt;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&lt;/i&gt; by William Blake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dip him in the river who loves water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most sublime act is to set another before you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fox condemns the trap, not himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is now proved was once only imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exuberance is Beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvement makes straight roads; but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough! or too much.</description>

  <description>Hoy estaba releyendo &lt;i&gt;Las Babas de Diablo&lt;/i&gt; de Julio CortÃ¡zar, porque me encontrÃ© por un momento mirando a las torres y torres de libros frente a mi cama... como si no tuviera nada pendiente. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inevitablemente me recordÃ© de &lt;span class='ljuser ljuser-name_dead_eifersucht' lj:user='dead_eifersucht' style='white-space:nowrap'&gt;&lt;a href='http://dead-eifersucht.livejournal.com/profile'&gt;&lt;img src='http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://dead-eifersucht.livejournal.com/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;dead_eifersucht&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; por varias razones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i. Por la entrada de "&lt;a href="http://dead-eifersucht.livejournal.com/251882.html"&gt;meta-thingies: self reference&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Nunca se sabrÃ¡ cÃ³mo hay que contar esto, si en primera persona o en segunda, usando la tercera del plural o inventando continuamente formas que no servirÃ¡n de nada. Si se pudiera decir: yo vieron subir la luna, o: nos me duele el fondo de los ojos, y sobre todo asi: tÃº la mujer rubia eran nubes que siguen corriendo delante de mi tus nuestros vuestros sus rostros. QuÃ© diablos." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ii. Y el "self-reference" en combinaciÃ³n con nuestro viaje perpetuo de Voyeur / Flaneur. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Creo que sÃ© mirar, si es algo que sÃ©, y que todo mirar rezuma falsedad, porque es o que nos arroja mÃ¡s afuera de nosotros mismos, sin la menor garantÃ­a, en tanto que oler, o (pero Michel* se bifurca fÃ¡cilmente, no hay que dejarlo que declame a gusto). De todas maneras, si de antemano se prevÃ© la probable falsedad, mirar se vuelve posible; basta quizÃ¡ elegir bien entre el mirar y lo mirado, desnudar a las cosas de tanta ropa ajena. Y, claro, todo esto es mÃ¡s bien difÃ­cil." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Michel es el narrador, que a veces se refriere a sÃ­ en tercera persona. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Curioso que la escena (...) tuviera como un aura inquietante. PensÃ© que eso lo ponÃ­a yo, y que mi foto, si la sacaba, restituirÃ­a las cosas a su tinta verdad." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y Ã©sta, que no tiene que ver con lo anterior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"...quÃ© palabra, &lt;i&gt;ahora&lt;/i&gt;, que estÃºpida mentira..."</description>
