One must let them lead and follow them to the unknown world. It is a safely structured journey for there is, after all, nothing to fear about words. Words are logically connected to one another so any nightmare elicited by them is just a permutation/ combination of logical possibility that may or may not need to be taken seriously unless there is another series of priorities backing up the reason why they should. Words are safer than ideas. An idea can kill or bring to life, but a word just renders an idea.&lt;br /&gt;If you don't like an idea, you can just criticise the way words are being said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to follow words.&lt;br /&gt;I don't know if anyone who reads my poetry thinks it's too good and I don't know why I am taking this chance to say it, but: It seems to me that when I write poetry it is a lot like following words or phrases and most of all the feeling behind them, into their structural unknown. Sometimes people ask me to explain my poetry to them and I then suffer a series of mental ticks trying to get my mind around explaining the same thing in &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; words. Truth is, there is no other way to say it, is there? Otherwise it wouldn't be a poem. It is a sad poem indeed that doesn't mind in the least being paraphrased.&lt;br /&gt;It is what it is what it is. It is me sitting down with a piece of paper and following words. It is like looking at the corner of another person's desk when you're in class and then suddenly going out of focus - you're looking there but you're not seeing what is there. It is like being out of focus until the someone (the teacher?) says your name. The small, foggy bit of unnoticed and very personal moment must be what is the experience of a poem. I can't explain a poem. I can only tell you what else it sounds like to me after writing, after getting out of the aforementioned out-of-focus zone. By being a viewer too. Or you can tell me what they sound like to you. But we can never tell each other what it IS in any other way. If we, god forbid, knew what a poet was actually thinking, we'd experience it in return, and not need to talk about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poems are personal. But the world needs personal. The world needs us to rearrange the words that exist in completely unique combinations so that new meaning can be released and dispersed into the air. The world is too lonely without us. And we are locked out of our own selves if we are not living by the world in some small way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5244387594869571713-1098441493291796919?l=emmbracingly.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/feeds/1098441493291796919/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5244387594869571713&amp;postID=1098441493291796919' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/1098441493291796919'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/1098441493291796919'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/2011/09/sometimes-words-are-neurotic-and-self.html' title='Sometimes words are neurotic and self-driven'/><author><name>Love Me Like A Badass</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08771937768187245960</uri><email>yabw.it@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</georss:featurename><georss:point>12.9715987 77.5945627</georss:point><georss:box>12.724026199999999 77.2787057 13.2191712 77.91041969999999</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5244387594869571713.post-8152567368437476806</id><published>2011-09-27T22:21:00.002+09:30</published><updated>2011-09-29T16:26:56.375+09:30</updated><title type='text'>One way to look at it</title><content type='html'>It's funny how in the end, you remember neither the good parts or the bad parts too well. They become so rehearsed in their retelling that words make an airtight compartment around each horribly good or spectacularly bad memory. What actually remains with you in its raw, visceral form are those scruffy memories (for they suddenly nag at you with their affection) that are neither here nor there, these are the&amp;nbsp; memories of confusion, the memories you don't know how to place in the silly narrative of your on-going life.&lt;br /&gt;The memories that are still open to interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;The memories you didn't heed to much because of their inherent, and apparently irrelevant confusion. And memories which may surprisingly hold the answer to something today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On some days, I am greedy for those memories which I haven't indoctrinised to fit into the glove that I use for my life. It is my past confusion that best gives me joy, motivation, best perspective, and deepest faith.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1'

scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lists'/><title type='text'>How to Diagnose Inner Flakiness</title><content type='html'>Note: A flake is when you have the condition of lying to yourself about what you want so that what you say you want fits into what you think others want you to want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example: You think that you want to wax because you want everyone to think that you care about your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Listen to yourself talk about doing something.&lt;br /&gt;ie, &lt;b&gt;"I am going to wax"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Watch yourself the way you do something.&lt;br /&gt;ie, &lt;b&gt;pass right by the beauty salon (or three) every single day&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Spot the contradiction in what you said and what you did.&lt;br /&gt;ie, &lt;b&gt;didn't wax&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Account for it to yourself by thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;ie, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hmmm, I guess I don't look all that bad with a little fur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Re-conclude what it was that you actually maybe probably wanted to do.&lt;br /&gt;ie,&lt;b&gt; not wax, probably&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Try to admit it. Start with a close friend who will wait till you finish talking so that you can explain it in your stumbling words and reluctant terminology. Ask this friend to rephrase what you said.&lt;br /&gt;Consider if it sounds true. Now try to go for the thing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friend: "Maybe you don't really believe in waxing if you haven't done it in so long. Maybe fur DOES look good to you and to a few other people who think like you. Surely someone you wanted to impress would be someone crazy like you who doesn't mind if you don't wax" - Ta-daaa!!!! Try to care about your appearance in some other way that makes more sense to you. Like wearing your favourite orange hat. ;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inherent problems with this approach:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said friend needs to be found on a day they have time, and patience on hands.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a long-term solution.&lt;br /&gt;If you don't talk to friend, you will drown in your own ocean of words and what will become very apparent lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ie, &lt;b&gt;EVERY SINGLE DAY AT BREAKFAST IN THE MESS TO ANY FEMALE/ GAY PERSON:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You: "I NEED TO WAX BOOHOO ;) LOLZ" &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Them: "So go na"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You: "Ya man I will be going today."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Them: "OK go. Phew, let's hope she talks about less embarrassing or personal things aloud from now on"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is also the problem with being a flake.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5244387594869571713-1377968404558013550?l=emmbracingly.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/feeds/1377968404558013550/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5244387594869571713&amp;postID=1377968404558013550' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/1377968404558013550'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/1377968404558013550'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-diagnose-inner-flakiness.html' title='How to Diagnose Inner Flakiness'/><author><name>Love Me Like A Badass</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08771937768187245960</uri><email>yabw.it@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5244387594869571713.post-3864463578837008273</id><published>2011-07-27T17:44:00.000+09:30</published><updated>2011-07-27T17:44:34.286+09:30</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='WOO HOO'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Celebration'/><title type='text'>I got blog award!!!!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

By never having an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Always agreeing with your friends about what restaurant is good, what to wear or buy, etc. Making friends feel they don't need to be corrected is not being a friend at all - it is being a person-shaped accolade and insulator against the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Be sympathetic when you're supposed to be, comforting when your friend is sad, and never challenge said friend's ideas, never laugh out loud at their miseries; always try to be helpful but by doing so, never actually help. If you know better than being "helpful", (such as being &lt;i&gt;truthful&lt;/i&gt;) you will always be a better friend but you may not always be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Don't follow up on things, plans, ideas and other ventures into unknowns that you planned together while drunk or on random Sundays. Let "career", "reponsibility" become more important.&lt;br /&gt;Worse: Using responsibility as an excuse to avoid adventure, as opposed to the only other forgivable reason, ie your mood says to chill and watch TV with a sack of chips or some such bad ass lazy thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Be a flake and not address it - disappear for a while and act like nothing larger was beckoning you to go away. If there was, share the story. Otherwise you are not a good friend, just a local celebrity with better things to do and some social service time you kill among minions like those with the misfortune of considering you their friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Don't point out the mistakes of your friends even if you know they could do things a better way, or a different way, especially when you know what that way is or have been through it all before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Letting friends make &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;severe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; instead of just "character building" minor mistakes is called not being a good friend in certain cases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Discourage them from following their dreams, no matter how bizarre even before they properly try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Be kind without even shouting or being depressed if they hurt or fail or disappoint you. Being kind is step 2. Your honest reaction should mostly be step 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Second-guessing the kind of emotions you ought to be displaying; censoring yourself for what you consider the benefit of others is just the sphinx-isation of your own self and a way of ensuring zero friends by old age.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5244387594869571713-3772003309852049763?l=emmbracingly.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/feeds/3772003309852049763/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5244387594869571713&amp;postID=3772003309852049763' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/3772003309852049763'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/3772003309852049763'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-be-really-annoying-friend.html' title='How to be A Really Annoying Friend'/><author><name>Love Me Like A Badass</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08771937768187245960</uri><email>yabw.it@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5244387594869571713.post-4236012122330465016</id><published>2011-07-12T02:26:00.002+09:30</published><updated>2011-07-12T03:08:25.241+09:30</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='leaving'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='flight'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Just A Thought'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='water'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='poems'/><title type='text'>Ode to...

Oh, and also learning how to become more like my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is the kind mystic who once told me how to be lazy: "Just be a burden to yourself". And although I do not understand what he said, the words have a sort of transcendental quality to them, don't you think? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to be a burden to yourself? It seems one heck of a paradox. The kind of paradox you have to tilt your head to one side in a perpendicular angle to think about for additional help from gravity, so that all the thoughts you get after that one, fall down together rightly half-suspended before they're ready and set to view through the real world again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: That's what I'm being. Buddhist, a burden to myself, and one more thing: A man. (ie abandoning myself with no fear of the consequences as only a man can).&lt;br /&gt;SO that's that.&lt;br /&gt;Happy almost 21 years of living to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I talke like this now because I juste aboute discoverede my newe wisdome teethe coming throughe on a coolz recente X-raye.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5244387594869571713-3690097351598489089?l=emmbracingly.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/feeds/3690097351598489089/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5244387594869571713&amp;postID=3690097351598489089' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/3690097351598489089'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/3690097351598489089'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/2011/06/self-abandomente.html' title='Self-Abandonmente*'/><author><name>Love Me Like A Badass</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08771937768187245960</uri><email>yabw.it@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5244387594869571713.post-3237385271555558325</id><published>2011-06-24T23:19:00.000+09:30</published><updated>2011-06-24T23:19:03.040+09:30</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='civilisation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='about school'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Frida Kahlo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Confession'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Things you don&apos;t know you don&apos;t know'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='season'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='slowness'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Randomly Now'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Devil&apos;s advocate'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mumbai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Celebration'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='home'/><title type='text'>Lack of routine puts me completely out of order!!!</title><content type='html'>A guy just has to get a shower, get a shave, and put on deoderant and some nice pants to look civilised and approachable again. Me, if I start abandoning myself, it would be an endless downward &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=deconstructivism"&gt;deconstructivist&lt;/a&gt;* spiral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I'd have not waxed, which would be noticeable if only by other women, as an outline of light fuzziness around the limbs. &lt;b&gt;Means I would have to wax.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I'd have not got my unibrow or moustache waxed, which &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; at first render a cool Frida-like, neo-feminist and bold bohemian appearance, but still basically make me feel like shit if I were to go out and hang out like normal people in the city of Mumbai, in Bandra where I happen to live (the one single place in the whole country where everyone dresses like Victorian pop stars [I swear to you! There IS such a thing!!!!]) &lt;b&gt;ie., I would have to fit the Normal Standards of Human Girl Face.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Not having a shower is OK as long as you don't stink, but done for too many days, my now much-longer-than-before mane starts looking making me overall look more like &lt;a href="http://bangsandabun.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Untitled2heads.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; wonderful man. &lt;b&gt;I would need to get a haircut.&lt;/b&gt; Weirdly enough, I am more attached to my hair now more than ever before. Seriously weird phenomenon this is, since this particular long hair hairstyle looks terrible on me, even if I say so myself. Maybe I am turning &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD3DcGIS9cc"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. ALL my clothes are starting to get rips or paint on them, making me look a part of a slowly ending world where... well, one grows out of civilisation in slow-mo. &lt;b&gt;I might need to do shopping.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Most women also recommend that other women go to beauty parlours and let them decide what else is wrong with the way they are looking. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I might need to do that, but I will &lt;/i&gt;not&lt;i&gt; do it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My question to you then, dear readers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can't a girl just take a vacation without having to permanently show for the damage in terms of dishevelment that might change and shape her and how she is viewed as a person forever and for posterity too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until there is an answer that includes things like "freedom and equal rights of women", "equitable soceity for all genders", "you're beautiful anyway" (heh), I shall shamefully admit, I want college to start and a busy life to force me to doing such things, because I can't seem to want to do them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;*The meaning of the word "Deconstructivist" is my recent addition to the urban dictionary, a place I am grateful for very much for letting us find or words for meanings that exist but haven't been caught yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5244387594869571713-3237385271555558325?l=emmbracingly.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/feeds/3237385271555558325/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5244387594869571713&amp;postID=3237385271555558325' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/3237385271555558325'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/3237385271555558325'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/2011/06/lack-of-routine-puts-me-completely-out.html' title='Lack of routine puts me completely out of order!!!'/><author><name>Love Me Like A Badass</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08771937768187245960</uri><email>yabw.it@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5244387594869571713.post-1179423342412879927</id><published>2011-05-28T02:49:00.005+09:30</published><updated>2011-06-08T04:25:15.361+09:30</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='trolleys'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sun'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HAPPY'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='poems'/><title type='text'>You</title><content type='html'>This is another in a series of recent odes I've been writing.

You're vaguely attractive mostly sometimes, are capable of sleeping around with whoever you want to, but don't. Incredible isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;Keeping someone else out of one's icky wicky should count as service to the world, for one does not add to the existing confusion between human relationships or their subsequent ever-expanding pool of pathogens.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Keeping one's modesty to oneself is a right to be exercised with pride, no regrets and of course, a fanciful air of mystery.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, there are other interesting things. (Also, being interested only in making people interested in you has got to be &lt;i&gt;sad&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You decide to stay home one weekend and instead of partying, spend it disinfecting every corner of your room or organising your stationery, thoughts and returning calls to various people who think more or less, well of you (which is more than can be said of what you think of &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, considering you're returning those calls so late).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You get distracted or bored easily. It may be that people who are bored easily are just HYPERINTERESTED in other things, could it not? You are not giving up if it is just to be drawn in by something else.&lt;br /&gt;No interest is less interesting than other interests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You don't do something all the young, active, happy people do with zest for whatever reason, because it does not elicit the same reaction in you, or you know something better that does. In other words, you have a different opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. You work hard, whether it's apparent or not, and ask for a break because you deserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. You enjoy additional breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. You talk to irrelevant people and/ or try to stir up interesting thoughts which may or may not be what you're required to do, but you do it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. You're in love with a construct made out of someone else's words and your imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. You think of old people, far and gone, as dear friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. You give those people and concepts chances mostly ignored by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. You have come to the conclusion that sometimes a vague life is better than a certain one. Or rather, personal certainty and social certainty are very different, and you choose to lose the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. You still enjoy silly games from childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13. You'd give up pretty much anything for pretty much anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14. You're just trying to make sense to yourself. Period, ovaries, and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15. You know no one else like yourself and yet you don't change. It's truly ridiculous of you, actually. But it doesn't make you too much of a giver-upper, either.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5244387594869571713-2698321140360602610?l=emmbracingly.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/feeds/2698321140360602610/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5244387594869571713&amp;postID=2698321140360602610' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/2698321140360602610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5244387594869571713/posts/default/2698321140360602610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://emmbracingly.blogspot.com/2011/05/why-youre-not-giver-upper.html' title='Why You&apos;re Not A Giver-Upper'/><author><name>Love Me Like A Badass</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08771937768187245960</uri><email>yabw.it@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5244387594869571713.post-4666402126968675843</id><published>2011-04-19T04:18:00.004+09:30</published><updated>2011-06-24T00:27:54.750+09:30</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='civilisation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='about school'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sun'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tears and trumpets'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Now'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Existential'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Just A Thought'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='journey'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='poems'/><title type='text'>Something I found on a crumpled piece of paper today!!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="background-color: black;

There was a lot more bling bling on it but it came off for its own reasons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The interesting story about this arm is that I was at &lt;a href="http://www.azaadbazaar.com/"&gt;Azaad Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; last to last Sunday and they put all this bling bling on my arm for free! :D Nice people are all around, people.

Healthy food is a shock to the system, but once the detoxification is over, I look forward to a longer, relatively monosodium glutomate-free life, amongst things like being cholestrol-, heart problems-, and diabetes-free life (I KNOW! I am such a worry wart, right? I can't help it! I HATE BEING SICK!
