Instead of studying for finals like I probably should have been doing, I opted to watch some mind-numbing media, which I rationalized by convincing myself my mind needed the rest. (It did, but it also needed the extra study time, as I have come to realize this week.) Among the movies I watched was a not-so-mind-numbing documentary called <em>The Human Experience, </em>that I landed on while looking for documentaries about dogs, all of which I think I&#8217;ve seen by now (Ok, so maybe I&#8217;m a little obsessed).</p>
<p>Alone with my laptop, in my pajamas, I was inspired and moved by this film, and I want to share it with the world (or at least anyone who reads this). The film, created by brothers Jeff and Clif Azize, chronicles their search for meaning and answers to questions like Why is life worth living? Who am I? and What are we all doing here?</p>
<p>They embark on a journey with their friends who are all young men living at St. Francis house in Brooklyn, a group home for struggling boys looking for a new start. Their stops include a week spent homeless on the streets of New York, an orphanage for ill and disabled Peruvian children, and a remote Leprosy colony in Ghana. Laced in with footage of these experiences are clips of commentary from philosophers, activists, psychologists, and other experts on their view of the human condition, and their answers to the questions the Azize brothers are asking.</p>
<p>The film, I think, has the power to move anyone who has a heart and a conscience. One of the most remarkable things about the documentary is that it has no single message; every viewer can take away a unique meaning. Among other things, what struck me most was the fact that these two brothers, still 18 and 27 at the time, set out on a mission to answer some of life&#8217;s biggest questions through experience, and through learning about the experiences of others.</p>
<p>There is no denying that the movie is very much related to social justice and community service. Their journey puts them face-to-face with, and in the shoes of people who are under-served in one way or another. The film sheds light on questions we all have and issues we all face, and potentially gives us a lead in the tireless search for meaning. I think what the documentary suggests is that the answers to the questions &#8220;what am I doing here?&#8221; and &#8220;why am I here?&#8221; won&#8217;t be found within ourselves, they&#8217;ll be found within each other.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the trailer:</p>
<p><object width="500" height="306"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LR41IE62n7I?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LR41IE62n7I?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="306" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brandeis is currently on break for Passover, one of the many Jewish holidays we get off. Right after break we have a week of class and then comes the infamous finals week. Unfortunately at Brandeis students hide out for weeks at a time in order to complete their finals, whether it&#8217;s necessary or not. Finals culture is also kind of fun due to the high concentration of people in study zones like the library and <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/communications/newsandcommunications/mediaresources/buildings.html">Shapiro Campus Center</a>. The Green Room (the main floor of Goldfarb library) is probably the worst place to study if you&#8217;re actually trying to get work done due to its uncanny resemblance to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48PvBTl3u8&amp;feature=related">Animal House</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Brandeis still tries to entertain us &#8211; even while everyone is trying to concentrate. May 1 is our annual Springfest music festival. This year features <a href="http://www.ofmontreal.net/">of Montreal</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdA2SAdSgc0">Dom</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY">Far East Movement</a>, and our very own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/AzizMakesMusic">Aziz</a>. Past years have been gorgeous, sunny days filled with free beer (for those over 21) and dancing. Hopefully the April rain with give us a break for the first day of May!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like  a number of students at Brandeis, I sing with an a cappella group,  which come in all types of flavors. A Cappella has become extremely  popular throughout college campuses, and I remember during my college  search four years ago that multiple places I visited claimed to have the  largest number of a cappella groups or the largest number of groups per  capita, based on the size of the student body. While I am not sure  where Brandeis stands in these respective lists, we have at least 12  based on<a href="http://my.brandeis.edu/clubs/index#6" target="_blank"> the official club listings </a> and around 3,200 undergrads, so that means 1 group for every 267  students (if we round up). The main point, regardless of specific  figures, is that we have groups that cover a broad spectrum of musical  and performance styles. My group, Jewish Fella A Cappella (JFA for  short) is Brandeis’ all-male Jewish themed a cappella group, and we sing  everything from traditional Hebrew melodies to contemporary songs by  Jewish composers. We sing both on and off campus, and last weekend we  traveled to Washington, DC for a national concert and competition of  Jewish a cappella groups. The event, Kol HaOlam, attracted an audience  of over 500 and consisted of groups from across  the country. While we  did not leave with any specific prizes, we felt great about our  performance (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HfcG-BAU7M">here’s a clip</a>) and were pleased that at least one local reviewer did as well <a href="http://www.gatherthejews.com/2011/04/first-report-from-the-jewish-a-cappella-competition/" target="_blank">(“my favorite song of the evening was “Bar Mitzvah” by Jewish Fella A Cappella”)</a>. Plus we had wonderful hosts in Washington DC and even had some time to see the pandas at the National Zoo!</p>
<p>Singing  with Jewish Fella A Cappella has been a lot of fun and a wonderful  learning experience, and I am sure those in other a cappella groups have  similar feelings. What I find particularly fascinating is how people  with a variety of musical backgrounds (theater, choir, band, or none of  the above) are able to combine their skills and present songs that make  use of each person’s  individual talents. Not only do you learn about  singing and music, you also learn how to work in a group in an  environment that is separate from the classroom. You learn how to work  past differences of opinion, deal with time constraints, and develop an  artistic vision. In this sense I am not surprised that a few months ago a  group of psychology students asked to observe our rehearsals to learn  about group dynamics (I am not sure if we ended up providing the ideal  case study, but we were happy to help them out). While rehearsals for  any group can be tiring at times, providing an entertaining performance  is very rewarding and generally helps you realize your efforts are  worthwhile.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know, I know I&#8217;ve already talked about Chums but this weekend is South by South Brandeis, an awesome concert put on by Punk Rock and Roll Club (<a href="http://www.punkrockandroll.com/">PRRC</a>), Brandeis Television (BTW), and the Brandeis Radio Station (<a href="http://www.wbrs.org/">WBRS</a>). This year features <a href="http://twitter.com/DASRACIST">Das Racist</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14925-autre-ne-veut/">Autre Ne Veut</a> on Friday night, as well as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5FqgVLfUA">Oberhofer</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/velvetdavenport">Velvet Davenport</a> on Saturday.</p>
<p>As most Brandeis students know, sometimes people complain about the social life &#8211; but come on, there is ALWAYS something to do! We can definitely thank PRRC for bringing rad bands to campus on the regular. Check out the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=212943965389036&amp;index=1">facebook event</a> for more details.</p>
<p>On another note, this week was <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=199100700120248">Bronstein week </a>- and we can thank <a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~studentevents/">Student Events</a> for all the activities they have put on for us. These homework distractions range from free Dunkin Donuts coffee to laser tag to free Thai food during an outdoor screening of Dazed and Confused to a BBQ to a rave party. Whew! Who&#8217;s complaining now?</p>
<p>My last plug(s): <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=144257615640655">Culture X</a> on Saturday and Liquid Latex next Thursday. Both events are school wide performances put on by students. Culture X focuses on bringing together different cultures and celebrating them all through dance, performance, etc. Liquid Latex similarly celebrates dance &#8211; but the performers are (almost) naked! Each group creates a themed dance and performs wearing only painted on latex. I&#8217;ve never been quite brave enough to be a dancer, but I am painting some bodies this year!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone gets a midnight cake on their birthday. It’s a tradition we started sophomore year, a surprise pink polka dot cake for my roommate, that morphed into peace sign cakes and rainbow cakes and for a neuroscience inclined friend, a brain cake. But my two favorites are the ones that I did not bake, the ones that were baked for me: my 20<sup>th</sup> birthday mitosis cake and my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday fruit fly cake.</p>
<p>The mitosis cake began with a cell biology joke that ran on for months. It’s no secret that I find cell division fascinating, so after a late wakeup for an early morning class, causing me to run about five minutes late on the day we would be discussing chromosome segregation, I rushed to the science complex only to get a text from my bio lab partner as I neared the building: “You love mitosis! Where are you?” So a few months later, blindfolded and kidnapped from my room at midnight on my birthday, I should have been more prepared for what awaited me when the blindfold was taken off.</p>
<div id="attachment_718" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/admissions/files/2011/04/mitosiscake.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-718" src="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/admissions/files/2011/04/mitosiscake-300x224.png" alt="A cake made to look like a cell dividing." width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Complete with candy organelles, a cell cake completing anaphase, progressing through telophase, and traveling into cytokinesis. </p></div>
<p>Twizzler chromosomes, Raisinet ribosomes, a golgi apparatus made out of Swedish Fish, and lime slice mitochondria. There were even Mike and Ikes to symbolize proteosomes, lysosomes, and “other -omes.” I loved it, both because of its geeky form and the thought and time that had gone into it, but I couldn’t help but wonder just how much of a nerd I had to be to not just bake my own geeky baked goods but have them baked for me. I did not think they could top it.</p>
<p>But March 31<sup>st</sup> was my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday and at midnight I was brought, eyes closed, into the dining room of our little rented house on South St. Surrounded by giggling and the smell of chocolate, I opened my eyes to see something that blew the last cake out of the water.</p>
<div id="attachment_722" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 622px"><a href="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/admissions/files/2011/04/flycakepic1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-722" src="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/admissions/files/2011/04/flycakepic1.jpg" alt="A cake covered in chocolate fruit flies" width="612" height="459" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Delicious, adorable fruit flies</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A chocolate cake, covered in fruit fly shaped cake balls. Made out of cake and frosting, covered with butterscotch, and topped with almond wings and candy eyes, they had even been frosted with differing stripe patterns to represent the different sexes. I could not speak. I was stunned and shocked and torn between feeling fantastic that I had friends who loved me enough to make a <em>Drosophila</em> cake, and a little scared at just how completely my thesis had taken over my life. But my birthday was also the last day of behavioral testing for my thesis, the last day of physically feeding fruit flies, and being able to end that day by sinking my teeth into a chocolate fruit fly was one of the most satisfying birthday gifts I’ve ever received.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/admissions/files/2011/04/basketball_12.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-736" src="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/admissions/files/2011/04/basketball_12.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="432" /></a>Adults often say that our generation is apathetic; we don&#8217;t care about the world around us; things going on in the news don&#8217;t inspire us to take action; we&#8217;d rather look at Facebook, or tweet about it. My experience at Brandeis has convinced me otherwise. When students here see room for improvement, they take the reins to make it happen. And they have fun doing it.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this was last year&#8217;s Haiti initiative after the earthquake that devastated the country. Within days, students and faculty at Brandeis joined forces to create a Haiti relief committee, and raise money and awareness for the cause. This committee is still going strong, putting on events and raising money for Haiti, and now Japan as well.</p>
<p>One of their biggest events was the Hoops for Haiti basketball game, which took place last spring, and will be taking place again this evening. Students purchased tickets to see their favorite faculty, staff, and administrators play on a team against all-start students, like the president of the Student Union, varsity basketball players, and other well-known faces around Brandeis.</p>
<p>This event reminds me how creative students at Brandeis are in their efforts to make change in the world. It also highlights the unique relationship students and faculty/staff have here. In an effort to raise money for two countries devastated by natural disasters, Brandeis students put on an event that brings us together for a fun game of basketball, and the opportunity to see your professors on the court! Not only is the cause a good one, but the event is something not to be missed. Students will band together and cheer for each other, in a hilarious rivalry with the people who will be editing their resume, or serving them lunch the next day.</p>
<p>In true Brandeis fashion, we bring together a strong community for a good cause. And the smacktalk between faculty and students is hilarious. The entire community has recieved a series of emails from the president of the Student Union, Daniel Acheampong, and Rick Sawyer (VP of Student Affairs), encouraging them to come out and support their team in an epic game of basketball. I would argue that most schools don&#8217;t have the same student/staff relationships that we have here.</p>
<p>The relationship we have with the people who work here is special, and extends beyond any office, cafeteria, or classroom. Our joint commitment to improve the world around us with real, tangible action is something that goes beyond dean and student. We are reminded in times like these, during great events like this one, though a desk may separate us, and one of us is paying while the other is getting paid, we are all a part of the Brandeis mission, and we work together to make it real. Even if it means being slammed dunked on by someone old enough to be your dad&#8230;</p>
<p>Check out the video, starring our newly-inaugurated President Fred Lawrence, and Student Union President Daniel Acheampong:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night was Frederick M. Lawrence’s Inaugural ball, and a ball it was. The night started off with a live swing band, transitioned into a Brandeis acapella performance and ended with a Brandeis DJ. Frederick and Kathy Lawrence were present the entire night, entertaining guests and looking lovely as they swept across the dance floor. Noah, the new president’s son kept Brandeis ladies busy as he danced the night away. The dance floor remained full until the music faded at 12:30 AM (the desserts had disappeared long before).</p>
<p>There has been buzz all over campus surrounding FML and his transition into presidency. Of course, he holds quite a lot of responsibility as president and the campus seems to have high hopes for him. FML is definitely a personable guy. In fact, a few of my friends had a private dinner with him the other night proving his accessibility. There have also been requests throughout the semester to hear from the student body – what do WE want?? It feels good to have a voice; we just hope to see tangible results stemming from the dialogue.</p>
<p>We wish you luck FML!</p>
