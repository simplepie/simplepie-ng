        <![CDATA[<p>
	After my trip to Edinburgh, I wrote a short report for the Centre for Social Impact, that they&#39;ve included on their <a href="http://www.csi.edu.au/news/Inspiration_from_the_Edinburgh_Social_Innovation_camp.aspx">website</a> and <a href="http://www.csi.edu.au/site/Knowledge_Centre/Asset.aspx?assetid=ae8816276468dd63">newsletter</a>. Thanks to CSI for their support of this trip and the recent publicity for my work. <p /> <div class="gmail_quote"><b>Report from SI Camp Edinburgh</b><p />After the Social Innovation camp here in Sydney last year, I headed to Edinburgh, keen to experience more of the great mix of people, ideas and action that come together for a Social Innovation Camp. The UK team have done several of these over the last few years, and they have the organisation pretty well sorted. There were about 60 people participating in the camp, mostly from Scotland and the UK, working on 6 ideas, turning them into working prototypes. Working away at their own SI Camp over the weekend were a groups in <a href="http://www.sicamp.org/social-innovation-camp-korea-%E2%80%93-2011/" target="_blank">Korea</a>, and we maintained a video link with them throughout the weekend.<p /> What really struck me right away was the range of diversity of the ideas which were presented and selected for the camp. You can check them out <a href="http://here." target="_blank">here.</a> All the participants gathered on Friday night, and after a quick intro to all the ideas, we were left to our own devices to mingle, chat, and get to know one another. Before I left for Edinburgh, Glen Mehn, one of the SI Camp organisers, had been in touch, and had suggested that I might like to work on the Invisible Ramps team. The idea behind Invisible Ramps is to create a way for people with cognitive and psychological disabilities to engage in a dialogue with each other, as well as designers and service providers, to identify issues and problems that arise in their everyday lives, and, most importantly solutions. <p /> Right from the start the Invisible Ramps team worked really well together. We were led by Andy, the idea originator, who had come up with this idea based on his own experiences, and on the Saturday we were given a really great introduction about the issues faced by our target audience by Kath. Both Andy and Kath have Autism Spectrum Disorders, so working with them meant that we had a rich source of stories, experience and knowledge informing our work at every juncture. It also had a profound impact on the way that we functioned as a group. The usual highly driven, tense and sometimes explosive environment of working with strangers under such tight time restraints was mediated by our group&#39;s commitment to working in a way in which both Kath and Andy could feel comfortable and participate fully. This heightened sense of respect and adherence to some basic time management and communication protocols that we established right at the beginning of our work together brought about an environment of quiet, thoughtful productivity, very different to any other I&#39;ve come across in a collaborative environment like this, and was commented on by the organisers and other teams. This is something I&#39;ll take away from my experience of the Camp as much as anything else, because it surprised me, and showed me a way of doing things that I really enjoyed.<p /> After 2 very full-on days, we all gathered on Sunday afternoon to see what everyone had come up with and celebrate our collective achievements. Exciting! Every project was able to show a working prototype and present a working project, based on the ideas that we had started with. Some the ideas had undergone quite radical transformations. Their were <a href="http://www.sicamp.org/food-radar-win-social-innovation-camp-june-2011/" target="_blank">prizes awarded</a> to some of the projects, but every one of the projects is well on its way to being a social innovation enterprise in its own right. Awesome. I&#39;m still in touch with the Invisible Ramps team, working out how I can play a role in continuing to develop this project. It has strong interest from several health service providers in Scotland, and a bright future. Without the opportunity to workshop it at the SI Camp, it might have stayed just an idea in Andy&#39;s head.<p /> Thanks to the wonderful people who I worked with on the Invisible Ramps team, Anna and Glen from SI Camp, AuSIX and The Centre for Social Impact. <p /> <br /> </div> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

      <title>Introducing Snook - Scottish service designers doing seriously good things</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>On my recent trip to Edinburgh for the Social Innovation Camp, I had the great pleasure of meeting some of the team from Snook <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wearesnook">(@wearesnook)</a>, a service design outfit based in Glasgow. After the camp I popped over to Glasgow for "picnic lunch" in their offices, to learn a little more about who they are, what they do, and to soak up some more of the Snook vibe.</p>
<p>Snook are led by the awesome duo Sarah Drummond <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rufflemuffin">(@rufflemuffin)</a> and Lauren Currie <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/redjotter">(@redjotter)</a>, and are joined by the very able crew of  Kirsty Sinclair, Karen Maxwell, and Andy Young. They do service design based on co-production with community and stakeholders, and are working on a number of projects all over Scotland. If you want to check out their work, you'll find it all on their lovely <a href="http://www.wearesnook.com/snook/">website</a>.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p>
<p>On the very wet Glasgow afternoon that I went to see them, the Snook team were up to their elbows working on a revitalisation project for King Street, Stirling, tentatively titled "Startup Street". Working with Stirling City Council and other partners, the Snook team are engaging community, corporate and commercial interests to creating social enterprises to revitalise the empty shopfronts, and create an alternative life and vision for King Street and Stirling, that brings new skills, enterprises and opportunities to an area faced with high unemployment and community disenfranchisement. Their vision, creativity, passion, openness and skill is evident in their work, which hums with energy, great ideas and a "can-do" attitude.</p>
<p>From my time I Snook I came away with a very important lessons that I wanted to share. Snook are experts in understanding and using the power of the story. Several of the Snook team have visual arts/design backgrounds, and this really shows. They are all about the story in their work - whether it's identifying problems, engaging communities, creating strategies, envisioning futures or selling solutions - and they do this very well. They find good themes, keep them simple, create great visuals and powerful metaphors; in their hands storytelling becomes an awesome tool for community action and social change. I was privileged to watch them brainstorm on the afternoon I was there, and it was inspiring.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Snook team for letting me into their world. This young team are doing seriously good things - I hope we can find a way to bring a little Snook magic to Australia some time soon.</p>

</p>One of my favourite spots in Barcelona is the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art MACBA. It sits in the heart of El Raval, one of those districts that mixes narrow straights and old buildings with cool little stores and bars, immigrants and young people. I've stayed in this area both times I've been in Barcelona, and have been lucky to be with Marcus, my bro, who is pretty much a local. I love the energy of the streets, and I think this video highlights it.

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p><p />I&rsquo;ll be reporting elsewhere in more formal terms about the SI Camp that I&rsquo;ve been attending here in Edinburgh, but I wanted to take the time here to share my personal experience, and reflect on my some of own learning so far.<p />I&rsquo;ve been working with a team on a project called &ldquo;<a href="From Social Innovation Camp Edinburgh - reflections on learning">invisible ramps</a>&rdquo;. I liked this idea when I first saw it, and was really pleased to be assigned to work on this project. The team (there are nine of us all together) is excellent. Everyone is really great, working well together, and the combination of skills in the team is wonderful. I have really been enjoying my role in the team, doing a bit of facilitation, keeping track of time and tasks, and helping out where needed. <p />Underlying all aspects of the work that we are undertaking as a group this weekend are the abilities and needs of people with cognitive and psychological disability. As well as being the key audience and stakeholder group for the site, two key members of our team are on the autistic spectrum. This has had a profound impact on the group, and the way that we are working together - things that I&rsquo;d like be able to draw on and bring into facilitation and team situations in the future.<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<br />Firstly, I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge the amazing efforts of Andy and Kath, who have communicated honestly and with much good grace and patience, the ways in which we could work together as a group that would best serve all our skills and abilities. By asking us all to carefully consider the ways in which we are working together and the impact of our actions on the people around us, we have created one of the most harmonious and satisfying teamwork situations that I have worked in, even given the highly charged atmosphere that goes along with the whole bootcamp experience.<p />There are some specific things that I have noticed that we are doing in our group that I believe are contributing to the success of our group effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>when working as a group, only one person speaks at a time. As a facilitator, I have tried to implement this countless times and in countless ways in group situations. To see it actually working quite organically, out of mutual respect, takes it to a whole new level. When done properly, it is really effective, it&rsquo;s not just matter of courtesy.</li>
<li>when addressing individuals, taking a second to call them by name and establishing a connection with them before you ask a question or begin a discussion.</li>
<li>name tags are important.</li>
<li>narratives are important. People feel empowered when they can bring their experience to the group and have it acknowledged.</li>
<li>vary activities regularly and allow for individuals to work through things on their own as well.</li>
<li>keep outside interference to a minimum. Distractions are not only time-wasters, they can be difficult or distressing for some people. If someone is going to join the group for any length of time, introduce them properly, explain the interaction scenario and give everyone time to adjust.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Now that I&rsquo;ve written these things in a list, it seems pretty simple, but these are all things that I might not have paid enough attention to in other situations. So thanks to Andy and Kath, I have developed some &ldquo;invisible ramps&rdquo; in my facilitation and groupwork practice. A real world outcome for me on this project before we&rsquo;ve finished the website. That&rsquo;s social impact.</p>

      <title>Computer Lab in a Wheelie Bin - introducing the iStreetLab</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>Over the next year I'm going to be working on some really interesting projects for Group X and QUT in Queensland. While I was up in Brisbane last month, I was lucky enough to catch up with Mervin Jarman at <a href="http://edgeqld.org.au/">The Edge</a>, and hear more about Mervin's work on the <a href="http://www.mongrelstreet.org/iStreet.html">iStreetLab</a> project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Edge, QUT (Queensland University of Technology) and a couple of other interested parties are working with Mervin and the local community in <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=inala+qld&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Inala+Queensland&amp;gl=au&amp;ll=-27.724867,153.049164&amp;spn=0.660086,1.053314&amp;z=10">Inala</a>, South Queensland,  to embed an iStreetLab mobile computing lab into the community. Mervin's vision is for the community to fit out the bin with what would best suit their needs, but he and his partner, Richard-Pierre Davis, have made some of these already, and they are powering away in London and Jamaica.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PIHQyOZNzac" frameborder="0" height="349" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mervin's got a compelling story to tell about what this project is about, and it comes straight out of his experiences of youth culture in his home town in Jamaica, and the role that art and technology have played in his life. This project is more about community and empowerment than the technology, about putting the technological means of production onto the streets where the young people gather, and, as Mervin puts it, "it comes to space, it makes the space". The labs should be professional quality, so that the contrast between the "rubbish" bin, and what's inside it is absolute. It's a powerful statement, and as much about the young people this project is reaching as anything else. A completed lab should be able to create high quality music, video, graphic and web outcomes, and provide an income to the young people running it. They should also be able to operate as mobile classrooms, offering skills based workshops wherever the need arises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home of the <a href="http://www.stylinup.com.au/">Stylin' UP</a> indigenous owned Hip Hop, RnB and dance music festival, Inala is the  first of what we hope will be several of these across Queensland. Mervin and Mick Byrne, from The Edge in Queensland have been working hand in hand with the community to put together a wheelie bin and a program that meets the needs of that community, and allows them to reach out to other communities in South East Queensland. I'm hoping to work with Mervin and Mick on extending the learning and education outcomes of iStreetLabs, particularly the community workshop programs. It's part of my work with Group X to create IT and ICT opportunities for young people in Queensland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you might be able to make out from&nbsp; the two images below, the completed wheelie bin will an independently powered, fully equipped computer lab, fitted out with seriously good gear including a Macbook Pro (in the lid), several Macbooks, high end projector, high res printer and scanner, audio mixer, speakers and whatever else the community can come up. The only BYO component is headphones.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mervin and Mick for looking after me on my recent visit to Brisbane. I'll be back soon to work on this with them some more, and in the meantime, I'm looking forward to catching up with Rich in London and seeing an iStreetLab in action. Watch this space!</p>

      <title>Douglas Rushkoff: Program or be programmed</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>Douglas Rushkoff is one of those thinkers who always leaves you thinking yourself and asking questions, lots of questions. Most recently I've been aware of his writing around corporatisation and alternative currencies, but his new book takes him back straight into the heart of digital culture, where I first came across his work. In this promo video for his new book, Rushkoff states his thesis: "If you don't know what the software you're using is for, you're not using it, but being used by it".</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	I&#39;ve been taking part in a self directed learning course online, around mobile learning <a href="http://mobimooc.wikispaces.com" target="_blank">http://mobimooc.wikispaces.com</a><p />It has been really interesting to be part of this process and this community of learning, and I plan to reflect on that soon, but for the moment, I thought I would tackle the Week 2 assignment in a very public way. At the moment this is a hypothetical mobile program, but it could be real . . . I&#39;m thinking of it more as a proposal or pitch.<p /> Using the template provided for the group, here&#39;s a an early version of a program. All comments and feedback will be very appreciated.<p /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Template for your mLearning project</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> </span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">1.

Provide a platform, promotion, and online community for the uploaded videos through youtube and social media.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> </span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">4.

      <title>3 ways to make any kid a computer game coder in under an hour </title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>Thinkspace at the Powerhouse Museum is running1 hour<a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/thinkspace/courses/school_holiday_workshops.php"> game programming workshops</a> during this school holidays, and at the last minute I found myself teaching 3 of these workshops today. We are teaching children 8 and over how to make a simple version of the game "Pong" in <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, an object orientated comptuer programming langauge which is designed for kids. It's very cool.</p>
<p>Peter Mahony here at Thinkspace had prepared a great little website that facilitated a turn key approach to this workshop, but because of the last minute nature of things, I didn't get to see it until about 15 minutes before the first workshop was due to start, so I put together my own resource. I watched this youtube tutorial uploaded by a Scratch fan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EzROnRfLwbk?rel=0" frameborder="0" height="390" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It taught me how to make the game, but it's a bit of a tricky process, and one you want to get right all the way through when demonstrating and asking others to follow along, so I made a little powerpoint presentation of this material. The presentation breaks the tasks down and groups them to make make my instruction flow nicely in steps. I played it on my laptop for myself (where the students couldn't see it), and demonstrated for them by actually building in Scratch on one of the interactive whiteboards in the room. This worked really well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;div style="width:425px" id="__ss_7575349"&gt; &lt;strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"&gt;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joysuliman/making-pong-in-scratch" title="Making pong in scratch">Making pong in scratch</a>&lt;/strong&gt; <iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/7575349" frameborder="0" height="355" width="425"></iframe> &lt;div style="padding:5px 0 12px"&gt; View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joysuliman">joysuliman</a> &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course Peter's material was really great for providing the workshop with some structure, and will be an excellent follow-up resource for the participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://scratch-thinkspace.weebly.com/">http://scratch-thinkspace.weebly.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I have 3 very effective, very different resources for teaching how to make a pong game in scratch, and a bunch of very happy "games programmers" as a result of the day's workshop.</p>

      <title>If you ever wanted to learn the Appalachian Dulcimer</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	I&#39;ve been mucking about with an Appalachian Dulcimer while teaching the <a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/thinkspace/courses/disability.php" target="_blank">Special Access Kit Music Workshops at the Powerhouse</a>. It&#39;s super easy to get a great sound, provided that the dulcimer is tuned. It&#39;s been a real hit in these workshops, because not only does it make a wonderful sound, it is beautiful to look at a pleasure to hold. It&#39;s surprisingly light, and because you place it flat on your lap while you strum, you feel like you are enveloped in the music while you are playing it. Several of the clients really enjoyed playing it in workshops the last 2 weeks. <p /> It&#39;s weaving a musical spell over me as well . . . so I&#39;ve been looking up resources to help me learn a bit more about it, and even how to play a few tunes. Here&#39;s some of the best stuff I&#39;ve found, just in case anyone else wanted to take a few lessons.<p /> This <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6200536_do-play-4-string-dulcimer_.html" target="_blank">article on e-how</a> was really useful because it explained how to hold the dulcimer and the role of the different strings.<p /> This video just really clearly shows the dulcimer being played, so it&#39;s easy to work out the tune and get going. I picked it up on the third try.<p /><iframe title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/e0ZeRKTikpY" frameborder="0" height="390" width="480"></iframe><p /> <a href="http://dulcimer-noter-drone.blogspot.com/2009_02_08_archive.html">This blog</a> has some pretty interesting insights into the different styles of playing, and some easy tunes to begin with.<p />This guy is awesome - definitely something to work towards! But there is also a good lesson on how to strum, if like me, you&#39;ve never played on of these instruments that you strum.<p /> <iframe title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QPkXda050FI" frameborder="0" height="390" width="480"></iframe><p /> If you&#39;re serious, and wanting to have a full course with tabs and video samplers, <a href="http://www.appalachiandulcimer.com/Dulcimer_Lessons.html">this site</a> is pretty great.

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>I'm reading Dan Pink's "Drive" at the moment, and thinking quite a bit about incentivisation. In this video, Pink summarises his argument, and it's quite simple really. There are 3 factors which lead to better performance and personal satisfaction: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, the animation is totally engaging. Thanks to the RSA for putting these out.</p>

      <title>Doing things for the first time</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>In the last few weeks I've found myself doing a few things for the first time. None of these tasks was particularly difficult or beyond my capabilities, but each of them presented the challenge of the unknown, and made me a little uncomfortable.Things like how to add a DNS and MX record to my domain.&nbsp; There's more of this sort of thing in the coming weeks and months, so I'm documenting what I have learnt as a kind of gentle reminder to myself each time, that although this particular task may be new, unfamiliar and uncomfortable, doing new things is something you've done heaps of times before. And it's all going to be alright.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do these things first thing in the day</p>
<p>2. Be patient and take your time</p>
<p>3. Repeat the task from the beginning as though you are doing it for the first time</p>
<p>4. Make a pot of tea</p>
<p>5. Ask for help</p>
<p>6. Be patient and take your time (yes, worth repeating)</p>
<p>7. Try something else</p>
<p>8. Don't assign any personal value judgements to your ability to complete the task until you have actually completed it.</p>

</p>On the weekend I was privileged to join the family and close friends of Sanaa and Hassan, to welcome Sanaa to Australia. Although they were married in Syria 6 months ago, The bride, Sanaa has only just arrived in Sydney to join her groom, Hassan. It was a happy occasion, and the celebration included excellent food, spontaneous poetry recitation and traditional songs to honor the bride, dancing and much love. <p>I took a small snippet of video on my phone, and edited it together using the ReelDirector app. Super easy. I also wanted to post using the Posterous app. All made on my iphone. Here's the result. </p><p>Congratulations Sanaa and Hassan.</p>

      <title>The lives of Jeramana children: a video made by Syrian kids</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	<p>While I was in staying with Fady and Samar's family in Jeramana, Damascus, I spent a lot of time with their children, Meeray, Karol and Danny. We made several little projects including a book of jokes, a song, and a photo album, but by far the most ambitious and successful project was this video that we made together.</p>
<p><strong>The lives of Jeramana Children</strong> by Karol, Danny and Meeray.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_video_embed'>
<a href="http://joysuliman.posterous.com/the-lives-of-jeramana-children-a-video-made-b"><img alt="" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/video.posterous.com/temp-2010-12-12/iGsHpuoBpmnBjoikCoqHfwaIJyrDbiaGceAoevzJgfikhAzzkAumBoaIgxFm/frame_0000.png" /></a>

</div>
</p>
<p>It's in Arabic, so here's a quick outline.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1: Bedroom </strong>The children wake, great each other and decide to watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2: Watching TV</strong> The children watch some TV before deciding to go the park</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3: At the park</strong> The children play and admire the flowers and birds</p>
<p><strong>Scene 4: Watching TV</strong> They watch their favourite TV program before the girls go the fitness club and Danny goes to the street to play</p>
<p><strong>Scene 5: At the fitness club</strong> The girls do a dance/aerobics class</p>
<p><strong>Scene 6: In the stree</strong><span style="font-family: mceinline;">t</span> The girls meet Danny who is riding his bike</p>
<p>The script, backdrop, voices, props and music are all the work of the children. Meeray came up with the idea and wrote the script. She wanted to show people what a day in their lives might be like. Karol coordinated the project, making sure that the backgrounds were ready, and helping with the shooting. Danny was in charge of props, and made the eyes for the sock puppets (using scrunched up sitcky tape and black texta). I did the shooting (very simple, just a video camera mounted on a tripod), and the editing in imovie. The music was made by the children in garageband. Lauren, a friend of mine, also gave us a hand with the shooting.</p>
<p>My idea was to provide the children an opportunity to use some  digital tools for creative expression. I thought it would be really  easy, but there were some factors I hadn't considered. They hadn't  really had a chance to use cameras, let alone a computer, before. It was  also a challenge to get them thinking creatively. The education system  in Syria is very structured, so they hadn't been exposed to many  creative expression activities before, it was an unfamiliar kind of play  for them. We worked on the small projects first, and this allowed them  to build the skills and confidence to make the video. They didn't want to appear in the video, so we came up with the sock puppets, inspired by a popular children's show.</p>
<p>Please enjoy, and let me know what you think!</p>

	I came across Slowmation at an Elearning event at Sydney Uni a few weeks ago, where I met Gary Hoban from the University of Wollongong. Slowmation is a simple stop motion narrative approach that students can use create a narrative around any topic that they are learning. I like how it hooks into the creative expression of stop motion, and leverages the power of the storytelling for learning. And of course there are cameras. In this piece of audio, Gary explains a little about <a href="http://coolthingsuow.blogspot.com/2010/12/slowmation-as-tool-for-learning.html">slowmation</a>. <a href="http://coolthingsuow.blogspot.com/2010/12/slowmation-as-tool-for-learning.html">http://coolthingsuow.blogspot.com/2010/12/slowmation-as-tool-for-learning.html</a><p /> Check it out at <a href="http://slowmation.uow.edu.au/cgi-bin/WebObjects/slowmation-PROD.woa/wa/default">http://slowmation.uow.edu.au/cgi-bin/WebObjects/slowmation-PROD.woa/wa/default</a>

	<p>I'm settling into my work on Refugee Buddy here at the Vibewire Enterprise Hub. I've met some of the other folks, set up my desk, and I'm taking a break from a long list of things to do, to reflect a little on how I got to this place in my life, and the learning I've discovered or rediscovered that has brought me here.<p /> <strong>Failure is not something to be afraid of</strong><br />Whenever I get that sneaky thought . . . what if this doesn't work out . . . I remember that I've been here before. Years ago I started a family business with my Mum when I had no idea of what I was doing. After we burnt through my parents' savings, we called it quits. It didn't work out. Sure, it sucked, but at least we had a go. We've both done lots of interesting stuff since then. Here's a another sneaky thought that I prefer to have . . . what if this actually works out . . . <p /> </p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/joysuliman/uDzO4MRp3iEzvGEQkoLe7YKbtg5S5m9TfhwD7o22xvjEMDYPvychcv34GgYn/View_from_Deir_Mar_Musa_Syria.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="View_from_deir_mar_musa_syria" height="333" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/joysuliman/nC0fhUJIW4hIjr9SoApQRjQ6fgnIEpZeRZehqhicTdCI95g3Sto4l5ARSGsz/View_from_Deir_Mar_Musa_Syria.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a>
</div>
</p>
<p><br /><strong>Surrender<br /></strong>This concept is a little complicated, but it keeps coming up in all different ways. Peter Mahony and I have spoken about it on a number of occasions. He describes the Brian Eno talk at the Opera House about 18 months ago, where Eno articulated a spectrum of experience at which control is at one end, and surrender is at the other. Earlier this year, I spent some time up a mountain in the desert at the Monastery of Mar Musa, taking a bit of spiritual time, and I learned the Lord's prayer in Arabic. The phrase which struck me, which is actually at the heart of the whole prayer is "thy will be done". I spent a whole day looking out into the desert and meditating on that phrase. It's not about giving up, it's about knowing where you can affect change, and whether or not it's worth it. So even as I am taking control of my work life, I'm also working out how the surrender in all of this operates.<p /> <strong>Be true and honest</strong><br />As kids, whenever we got angry, frustrated or hurt, my Dad would always ask us to consider our behaviour before we lashed out or got revenge. He'd ask us to act according to our values, and not lower ourselves just to retaliate. Sometimes I fall short, but truth and honesty are where I'm always aiming.<p /> <p /><p /><p /></p>
