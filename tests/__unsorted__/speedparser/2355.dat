			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been introducing some friends to the Ealing comedies. We started with the Lavender Hill Mob, which was showing at a few London cinemas in a restored print, and followed a couple of weeks later with Kind Hearts and Coronets.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen either one, I&#8217;m about to spoil the endings. I&#8217;m also going to spoil the ending of Anatomy of a Murder so don&#8217;t read further if you haven&#8217;t seen those films.</p>
<p>The crooks in the Lavender Hill Mob don&#8217;t get away with their heist and, though the ending of Kind Hearts is ambiguous, it&#8217;s fairly likely that the central character there doesn&#8217;t get away with his crimes either.</p>
<p>That ambiguity was a little too much for the Americans, however. An extra 10 seconds of Kind Hearts was filmed which did away with the ambiguity so that the film would comply with the US Production Code.</p>
<p>Watching those films raised a question that has puzzled me for years. When did crime begin to pay in the movies? The Ealing comedies are notable for their witty approach to ensuring that the crooks don&#8217;t get away with it but they still put you in the position of rooting for the criminals, only to disappoint you at the end. They simply aren&#8217;t allowed to give you the satisfaction of seeing Alec Guiness&#8217;s bank robber enjoy his riches.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ve also seen films in which the crooks to get away with it. Whether they are heist films or courtroom dramas with a twist, at some point it became acceptable for the bad guys to succeed. But when?</p>
<p>The Motion Picture Production Code provides a clue. The code set the boundaries of what was allowed on film. Obvious things such as nudity and swearing were prohibited. There were also rules about interracial relationships, homosexuality and, of course, crime. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code">According to Wikipedi</a>a, the code required films to ensure &#8220;that throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia entry lists Anatomy of a Murder as one of the films that helped to bring about the Code&#8217;s demise. That film deals with the trial of an army lieutenant who is accused of murdering an innkeeper. He claims that the innkeeper raped his wife.</p>
<p>James Stewart&#8217;s lawyer manages to get the lieutenant acquitted but the end of the film casts doubt on the man&#8217;s story. The innkeeper may not have raped his wife after all and the lieutenant may have killed him in a drunken rage.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s possible that the criminal got away with it in Anatomy of a Murder but, again, like Kind Hearts and Coronets, it&#8217;s not explicit. My search goes on for the earliest film in which the criminals escape justice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot to love about the new film version of <a href="http://www.shanerichmond.net/?p=88">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</a>. It&#8217;s beautifully directed and filled with impeccable performances.</p>
<p>The scene in which Gary Oldman&#8217;s Smiley recounts his meeting with his nemesis, Karla, is particularly stunning. The locations are wonderful and elements of the set design &#8211; a chandelier here, a fairground dragon there &#8211; make for some memorable scenes.</p>
<p>The film doesn&#8217;t entirely avoid the perils of adapting a complex book. The first 20 minutes feel rushed as the film struggles under the weight of exposition and the closing montage is cheesy.</p>
<p>The script makes some inexplicable changes to the plot, few of which are an improvement. There are some inconsequential alterations: Jim Prideaux&#8217;s mission takes place in Hungary, not Czechoslovakia, Ricki Tarr is sent to Istanbul, rather than Lisbon, and the Russian source is &#8220;Witchcraft&#8221; instead of &#8220;Merlin&#8221;. There&#8217;s no obvious reason for those changes but they don&#8217;t make anything worse.</p>
<p>Peter Guillam, Smiley&#8217;s right-hand man in Tinker Tailor…, runs MI6&#8242;s &#8216;scalphunters&#8217;, the team that deals with the secret service&#8217;s violent, dirty jobs. In the book he&#8217;s straight but in the film he&#8217;s gay. When Smiley warns him that he will be watched closely, Guillam goes home and makes his boyfriend move out. That provides a nice Hollywood opportunity to show what he is sacrificing for his work but does it make sense?</p>
<p>Presumably Guillam now thinks he&#8217;s at risk of blackmail but given his job, surely that was a risk before? Is it possible that someone in his position could live with a man and expect nobody to notice?</p>
<p>More troublesome is the film&#8217;s device for visualising the suspected Russian agent at MI6. The head of the service, Control, suspects one of his five key lieutenants. The film has him attach little photos of each man to chess pieces, implying that Control is having trouble remembering what his colleagues look like.</p>
<p>When Control briefs Prideaux he shows him the chess pieces. Each man is represented by a different piece. They need a code so that Prideaux can tell Control which man is the traitor. In this case, surely Control would choose King, Bishop, Knight, Rook and Pawn? Adding another layer by going for Tinker, Tailor, etc., just seems perverse.</p>
<p>Those are nitpicks, really. The only change that really irritated me &#8211; and one that significantly weakened the film &#8211; was the decision to open with Prideaux&#8217;s failed mission. One of the joys of Le Carre&#8217;s plot is that the precise details of the mission unfold as Smiley pursues his investigation and the film blows that in its desire to open, literally, with a bang.</p>
<p>This is a great film but not the masterpiece that many critics have claimed it to be.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Prince wrote the words &#8220;tonight we&#8217;re gonna party like it&#8217;s 1999&#8243; he was thinking about the end of the world. Last night, when he kicked off the song, the lyrics just meant &#8216;let&#8217;s party like we did in the old days&#8217;.</p>
<p>Gone is the Prince who looked forward, who experimented with electronica, who was such a classic-spewing genius that he could record Sign O The Times <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_o%27_the_Times_(song)#Composition_and_arrangement">using the pre-programmed sounds on the Fairlight synth</a> and still make it sound like nothing anyone had ever head. Now we have a Prince who looks back and reminds us at every interval that &#8220;this is real music, with real musicians&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pity that Prince has such a negative view of technology and such an obsession with what he sees as authenticity. An electric guitar is, after all, a machine. But really it is Prince the artist who has the problem here and, honestly, that guy&#8217;s creative peak was the extraordinary period between 1982 and 1987. In that short period Prince accomplished more than most artists do in a lifetime. His output has been estimated by scientists to be roughly equal to 1,348 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIT_School">BRIT schools</a>.</p>
<p>The decline of Prince the artist did not affect Prince the performer, who remains a startling and awesome force on stage &#8211; James Brown, Michael Jackson and Jimmy Page packed into one little body. His charisma is such that he can pull of things that from another performer would be cheesy or sleazy and still seem like the coolest man on the planet. He&#8217;s also the only Jehovah&#8217;s Witness you&#8217;d be happy to open the door to.</p>
<p>His set at Hop Farm last night contained several of his greatest songs but left many more unplayed. There was no room for When Doves Cry, Seven, I Would Die 4 U, Pop life, Alphabet St, Diamonds and Pearls, My Name Is Prince, Thieves in the Temple, Gett Off, Sometimes it Snows in April or The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. Who else could leave that many great songs off <a href="http://prince.org/msg/12/359173?&#038;pg=34">the setlist</a> and still deliver a show as good as last night&#8217;s?</p>
<p>There were brilliant versions of Little Red Corvette, Kiss and Controversy as well as a take on Purple Rain that seemed to last for half the set but there were also lots of covers. I agree with <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/lucyjones/100054568/pulp-schmulp-prince-is-still-the-best-live-act-in-the-world/">my Telegraph colleague Lucy Jones</a> that more Prince classics and fewer covers and funk workouts would have been more satisfying but I think it&#8217;s the covers that drive Prince&#8217;s enthusiasm. And more importantly the covers add an excitement and unpredictability that is missing from other nostalgia acts.</p>
<p>At the same time as Prince was playing at Hop Farm, a reformed Pulp were playing in Hyde Park. Much as I like Pulp, I&#8217;m not disappointed to have missed them. I saw them several times back in the days when Disco 2000 was a song about the future. Their <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/pulp/2011/hyde-park-london-england-7bd36e9c.html">setlist last night</a> was basically the same as the ones I saw then. Of course they&#8217;ll play Common People and Do You Remember the First Time? and Babies. How could they not?</p>
<p>One of the things I value most in a gig is the unpredictable &#8211; as you can probably guess <a href="http://www.shanerichmond.net/?p=551">from things I&#8217;ve written before</a>. There can be no element of surprise in watching the reformed Pulp, just as their wasn&#8217;t when Blur reformed two years ago. That&#8217;s not to say that there is anything wrong with watching either but it&#8217;s a comforting experience &#8211; like re-watching a favourite movie &#8211; rather than a thrilling one.</p>
<p> I could happily have watched another hour last night. Prince&#8217;s genius as a performer is that he has managed to maintain an electrifying unpredictability in what is still in essence a nostalgia act.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost 20 years since I last worked in a bookshop and I&#8217;ve forgotten most of the very daft things customers said but two particular questions have stayed with me. The first was from the woman who asked whether we had a copy of Shakespeare&#8217;s A Night in the Stream. It took a good few minutes to figure out that she was after A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream.</p>
<p>I worked in bookshops for about four years and I was very good at keeping a straight face no matter how silly the question I was asked. However, there was one occasion when I couldn&#8217;t control myself. </p>
<p>It concerns <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Orchid">Desert Orchid</a>, the horse. You might not remember much about Desert Orchid, the horse, but you probably remember that he was a horse. You will understand, then, why I laughed when a woman came in and said to me: &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for the new book about Desert Orchid. I think he wrote it himself.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Done well, a long novel can be immensely satisfying and offer a chance to explore a character in greater depth than is possible in three hundred pages. Part of the emotional weight of <a href="http://www.26books.com/2008/08/war-and-peace-by-leo-tolstoy-shanes-book-29-2008/">War and Peace</a>, for example, comes from the exquisitely long time over which the story unfolds. However, a long novel does take stamina and perseverance.</p>
<p>At The Millions, Mark OConnell has <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2011/05/the-stockholm-syndrome-theory-of-long-novels.html">written a good piece</a> about the challenge of long novels:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I used to take a wan pleasure in telling friends who had returned from a tour of duty with War and Peace or The Man Without Qualities with that I’ve-seen-some-things look in their eyes—the thousand-page stare—that they had been wasting their time. In the months it had taken them to plough through one book by some logorrheic modernist or world-encircling Russian, I had read a good eight to ten volumes of svelter dimensions. While they were bench-pressing, say, Infinite Jest for four months solid, I had squared away most of the major Nouveau Romanciers, a fistful of Thomas Bernhards, every goddamned novel Albert Camus ever wrote, and still had time to read some stuff I actually enjoyed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually OConnell began reading longer books and makes this interesting observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you read the kind of novel that promises to increase the strength of your upper-body as much as the height of your brow—a Ulysses or a Brothers Karamazov or a Gravity’s Rainbow—there’s an awe about the scale of the work which, rightly, informs your response to it but which, more problematically, is often difficult to separate from an awe at the fact of your own surmounting of it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s true to an extent but it also doesn&#8217;t really matter. The scale is an intrinsic part of the work and responding to that is as valid as responding to the characterisation or the prose or the plot.</p>
<p>OConnell&#8217;s characterisation of being in the midst of a long novel as a kind of Stockholm Syndrome is not entirely convincing. It assumes, for example, that stretches of these books are intrinsically torturous, which I&#8217;m not convinced is true. However, his argument is witty and worth reading.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read a lot of long novels and people occasionally ask me how I do it, as if I&#8217;ve climbed a mountain or something, rather than simply having turned a lot of pages. Leaving aside the difficulty of the work &#8211; there are 200-page novels that are difficult to read too &#8211; it really is just a matter of starting at the beginning and reading one page at a time until you come to the end.</p>
