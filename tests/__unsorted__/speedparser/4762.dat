Club member and Assistant Governor Dr. Ali Follad picked up the shield on behalf of the Club at the recently concluded District Conference in Luxor in Egypt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to have received this deserved award for our club. We are the uncontested pioneers in the region &#8211; as the shield attests &#8211; in adopting and adapting new and old media in order to propagate the messages of Rotary within the community,&#8221; RCA President Mahmood Al-Yousif commented, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t stop just at creating an excellent website, but made sure that all other aspects of social media are well integrated within the PR portfolio as well as introduced virtual meetings by virtue of the availability of audio and video podcasts to allow anyone interested to listen in to our meetings in a very transparent and professional manner. We are confident that the Club will build on this award in the coming years for the benefit of our members and the community,&#8221; President Al-Yousif concluded.</p>
<p>The Club wishes to thank all members of the press for their professionalism in covering Club events and hope that they will continue to be the effective partner in allowing the Club to communicate its messages to the community at large.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most undefined positions in Rotary in my very short experience must be what the Sergeant-at-Arms does, what his or her duties are and if that position is actually elected or assigned. I&#8217;m happy to say that this has been unveiled recently in a Rotary.org article which I shall share with you here. Although not complete, but one can clearly and in not ambiguous words understand the essence of that position:</p>
<blockquote><div id="attachment_1296" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://www.rotary.org/en/MediaAndNews/News/Pages/110512_news_history.aspx?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rotary%2FPBqj+%28Rotary+International%29"><img src="http://rotaryadliya.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sergeant-at-arms-69.jpg" alt="" title="sergeant-at-arms-69" width="550" height="370" class="size-full wp-image-1296 aligncenter" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chief sergeant-at-arms H. Tucker Gratz raises the symbol of his office at the 1969 convention in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. With Tucker are some of his assistants: Ray Faisst, of El Paso, Texas; Paul Heckenlively, of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Jack Ma, of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada; and John Young, John King, and Edward Armstrong, of Honolulu.</p></div>
<p>A nyone who has attended a Rotary convention is familiar with the sergeants-at-arms. Since the first convention in 1910, these men and women in yellow vests have guided Rotarians and their families.</p>
<p>During this year’s convention, 21-25 May, the sergeants-at-arms &#8212; this year known as Rotary guides &#8212; will sport a new look, designed to keep them cool in the often-steamy weather of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Instead of the usual yellow vests, the guides will be wearing yellow sashes. The hundreds of volunteers who assist them will sport red ones, in a nod to the red vests they’ve traditionally worn.</p>
<p>Sergeants-at-arms have a long and distinguished history in Rotary. The organization’s first constitution established the position as an elected officer of the association. Werner Hencke, of St. Louis, Missouri, was the first to serve in the role. He was charged with maintaining order at meetings, including the convention, which functioned as Rotary’s legislative body in its early years.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s another <a href="http://www.rotary9790.org.au/info/sergeant.asp" target=_blank>excellent resource</a> which details the history and duties of the very important position a sergeant-at-arms hold in Rotary.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is with deep regret that we are forced to cancel the planned RCA Bahrain Model United Nations for 2011. It would have been our 17th and this is the first year that the Club cannot hold such an important event for Bahrain. The fault is not ours, we have tirelessly worked since 2010 to make this event happen, but due to the incidents in Bahrain which prompted the declared State of National Safety, mounting any event or holding any meeting necessitates the gaining of express permission to hold such an event from the Ministry of Social Development and other state entities. Until this morning (Thursday 12 May 2011) we were unable to get that permission from the Ministry of Social Development although they have had all the required and requested documentation for some time.</p>
<p>As the declared date for holding the BahMUN XVII on Saturday the 14th nears, it is not legally possible for us to hold such an important event, even though we have prepared every possible thing to ensure its success.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologise to the participating schools, directors and most importantly the students who have avidly looked forward to participating in the 17th RCA BahMUN.</p>
<p>As club President, I would like to render my deep thanks and gratitude to the members of the BahMUN committee, all of whom worked tirelessly and selflessly to ensure the success of this event, had it taken place, I am confident that it would have been one of the more successful BahMUNs the Club held. In particular I should like to thank Past District Government Nijad Al-Atassi, PP Redha Faraj, Honorary Secretary Rotarian Laith Shukayr, Service Projects Chair Rotarian Ms. Khulood Al-Qattan, Vocational Subcommittee Head Rotarian Fareed Bushehri and BahMUN Coordinator Ms. Lorraine Fernandez in addition to everyone at the club who have been exemplary in their support.</p>
<p>The Club remains determined to do whatever is necessary to help the community in Bahrain to the best of our capabilities and are confident that we shall organise an excellent BahMUN during the next Rotary year.</p>
<p>Students and schools who wish to receive a refund of their registration fees, please email our executive secretary Mr. Binu at <a href="mailto:binu@rotaryadliya.org?subject=Refund of RCA BahMUN XVII Fees Request&#038;cc=bahmun@rotaryadliya.org">binu@rotaryadliya.org</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday 11 April 2011, the Rotary Club of Adliya was thrilled to welcome Mr. Hasan Hujairi who talked about his doctoral thesis in Ethnomusicology and his experience to pursuing studies in Bahrain, Japan and lately the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rotaryclubofadliya/sets/72157626355821157/with/5611860329/" target=_blank><img src="http://rotaryadliya.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/hasanhujairi.jpg" alt="" title="hasanhujairi" width="500" height="155" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1287" /></a></p>
<p>Hasan Hujairi feels that making music is similar to writing a story; his tale is one with many chapters. He has studied classical guitar in Bahrain and the United States, and learned the floating-bridge oud under Iraqi virtuoso Saad Mahmoud Jawad. A coveted scholarship from the Japanese government led him to delve into the Maritime History of the Gulf, while interning at Tokyo recording studios and playing at spots like the Imperial Hotel and NHK Broadcasting Museum. Hasan was a participant in the 2010 Red Bull Music Academy and is currently a PhD student at the University of Exeter in the field of Ethnomusicology. His last album (‘Manama and Other Spices’) incorporates field recordings made on cassette recorders &#8211; spiced up with tube effects. Hasan is an active sound artist and has presented some of his works in art spaces in Bahrain and the UK.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The RCA Charity Cricket Tournament was a success, thanks to the efforts of the organising committee comprised of PP Hasan Balooshi, Rotarian Zoher Taherbhai and Mr. P. K. Ravi.</p>
<p>All the teams thoroughly enjoyed themselves and the competition. Their participation and the perseverance of the organising committee managed to raise over BD3,500 with net proceeds in excess of BD2,000 which shall of course be dedicated to the club&#8217;s charitable causes.</p>
<p>We would like to once again thank every participant, spectator and of course the generous donations of individuals and companies without whom none of this could have happened.</p>
