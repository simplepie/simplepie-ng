        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shh&#8230; Don&#8217;t tell my editor I&#8217;m blogging. I&#8217;m procrastinating by writing this blog post instead of working on <em>Programming Node</em>. I&#8217;ll still get to that, but this is on the brain right now.</p>

<p>Today marks the <a href='http://calendaraboutnothing.com/~tswicegood'>50th straight day</a> of pushing code to GitHub. My work on <a href='http://armstrongcms.org/'>Armstrong</a> has made a lot of this possible&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to push code when you&#8217;re getting paid to write open source software&#8212;but not every day has been Armstrong related code.</p>

<p>During the course of the last 50 days, I&#8217;ve rediscovered a few things that I want to share, in case anyone else thinks that they can&#8217;t possibly do this without changing jobs.</p>

<h2 id='keep_it_small'>Keep it small</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve written about <a href='http://www.travisswicegood.com/2010/12/15/on-writing/'>manageable chunks</a> in writing, but not in contribution. It&#8217;s easy to make excuses about why you aren&#8217;t pushing code on a daily basis. You need to clean the code up; its not good enough, yet; or it&#8217;s not really significant enough to make a difference.</p>

<p>Excuses. All of them.</p>

<p>Every single piece of code you write has importance. Otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t write it. There are <a href='https://github.com/nickmartini/dongml'>exceptions</a> to this <a href='https://github.com/martinemde/dicks'>rule</a>, but those are outliers. Most of the stuff you and I would write and go to the trouble of committing is going to be useful to someone.</p>

<p>Case in point, earlier this week I helped add some interactivity to a <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/82nd-texas-legislature-budget-shortfall-timeline/'>timeline on the Texas Tribune</a>. My contribution was trivial, but it might be useful to someone trying to do something similar, so it&#8217;s <a href='https://github.com/texastribune/interactive.budget.battle'>up on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id='theres_always_something'>There&#8217;s always something</h2>

<p>There is always something you can do with 5 minutes. I&#8217;ve made a lot of contributions to <a href='https://github.com/revans/bash-it/'>bash-it</a>. Think of it as your terminal on steriods, with pretty colors. I started out with some minor tweaks, then found some places where code could be better handled, then other devs built on that, and I&#8217;ve started refactoring some other parts.</p>

<p>I spend the vast majority of my time looking at a terminal, so it needs to fit like a glove. Working on bash-it means I&#8217;m getting more and more familiar with my environment and making some pretty cool enhancements.</p>

<p>Find something that you use, something that would make your life a little bit better if it just had X, then go to town and try to figure out how to do X in it. My bash programming sucks. Seriously, I wouldn&#8217;t know where to start to write a real bash program, but I can muck around in the internals and figure it out. Just because you don&#8217;t know how to program in a language doesn&#8217;t mean you: 1) can&#8217;t, 2) shouldn&#8217;t, 3) aren&#8217;t fully capable of figuring it out as a smart human being which I know at least <em>some</em> of you are.</p>

<h2 id='just_start'>Just start</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s really easy to get part of the way through a month and say &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ll start the first of next month.&#8221; No. No you won&#8217;t. Well, if you&#8217;re me you won&#8217;t. I have a horrible tendency to want to go big or go home. Not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but not good for just getting shit done.™</p>

<p>It&#8217;s especially bad when &#8220;going big&#8221; is &#8221;I&#8217;m going to commit code every day in a month&#8221; and you&#8217;re already into an existing month. Then ya wait and you lose that initial momentum.</p>

<p>So the answer for me is to just start. The raw #s are what matters. Get out there, do something, start tallying it up.</p>]]></content>

        <title>Armstrong on Vagrant</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2011/06/07/armstrong-on-vagrant/"/>
        <updated>2011-06-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2011/06/07/armstrong-on-vagrant</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We released our first version of <a href='http://armstrongcms.org/'>Armstrong</a> this past Wednesday. After taking a quick breather, I set out on getting Armstrong setup inside a <a href='http://vagrantup.com/'>Vagrant</a> virtual machine to make evaluation easy. I finally got it running. There&#8217;s more information about getting started <a href='https://github.com/armstrongcms/armstrong_on_vagrant#readme'>in the README</a>, where it belongs, but I ran into some interesting technical issues while setting it up that I want to document here.</p>

<h2 id='vagrant__puppet__pip'>Vagrant + Puppet + pip</h2>

<p>I initially wanted to create a full build-script inside Vagrant that could be used to setup the entire environment. I used <a href='http://www.puppetlabs.com/'>puppet</a> to start the process and found the <a href='https://github.com/rcrowley/puppet-pip'>puppet-pip</a> provider so I was even going to be able to install Armstrong easily. Or so I thought.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something that is happening when puppet runs <a href='http://www.pip-installer.org/'>pip</a> that causes the installation to fail. I&#8217;m a big subscriber to <a href='http://www.travisswicegood.com/2009/01/04/select-isn-t-broken/'>select not being broken</a>, but in this case I think there&#8217;s some odd in the combination of pip and puppet. The reason is that <code>pip install armstrong</code> via an ssh connection to the same virtual machine works. After briefly discussing it on #pip on Freenode, I opened <a href='https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/298'>ticket #298</a> which outlines the issues we ran into.</p>

<p>I finally decided to go the pragmatic route. For the time being I have a box that&#8217;s installed the way you would if you had a raw box yourself. It&#8217;s not ideal, but our new <a href='https://boxes.armstrongcms.org.s3.amazonaws.com/armstrong.box'>armstrong box</a> (warning, that&#8217;s a 500mb download) boots up with everything you need to start playing with Armstrong.</p>

<p>Eventually, either I&#8217;ll figure out what the issue with pip+puppet is or I&#8217;ll switch to some other method that will work. My reason for picking puppet was pretty simple. The <a href='http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/provisioning.html'>provisioning</a> section of the <a href='http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html'>getting started</a> guide for Vagrant shows you puppet code and says essentially &#8220;Chef it too complex to simply show you how, so just use this prepared stuff.&#8221; I like simple. Right or wrong decision, I&#8217;m not 100% sure yet.</p>

<h2 id='django_server_on_bootup'>Django Server on Bootup</h2>

<p>The server runs on startup thanks to <a href='http://upstart.ubuntu.com/'>upstart</a> in Ubuntu. As far as Ubuntu is concerned, Armstrong is now a service that can be started and stopped with <code>start armstrong</code>, <code>stop armstrong</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Upstart works on the concept of events. Different tasks emit different events that other tasks can be configured to react to. There&#8217;s a <code>startup</code> event and a <code>net-device-up</code> event and so on. I tried all manner of combinations before it dawned on me, the VM is booting, then Vagrant is mounting the NFS with the project.</p>

<p>Once I figured that part out, <a href='http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#run-a-job-when-a-file-or-directory-is-created-deleted'>this recipe</a> helped get things started. A quick task that starts monitoring for the <code>config/development.py</code> file that is mounted after booting was all I need to get <code>runserver_plus</code> going on &#8220;bootup&#8221;. You can check out the upstart scripts being used <a href='https://github.com/armstrongcms/armstrong_on_vagrant/tree/master/upstart'>in the repository</a>.</p>

<p>I chose <code>runserver_plus</code> from <a href='https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions'>django-extensions</a> rather than the built-in <code>runserver</code> because of <a href='https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15880'>issue 15880</a>. Since I&#8217;m starting the script on start up, there&#8217;s no interactive interface and the watcher gets a little wonky. It works out though, because you get the awesome <a href='http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/debug/'>werkzeug debugger</a> for development.</p>

<h2 id='closing'>Closing</h2>

<p>Minus a few oddities in the process, I&#8217;m really pleased with the end result. It should be noted that this is meant for <em>development only</em>. As we near our first stable release later this year I hope to be able to create another box that&#8217;s more deployment ready, but hopefully this will get you started down the right path.</p>]]></content>

        <title>TekXI Recap</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2011/05/28/tek11-recap/"/>
        <updated>2011-05-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2011/05/28/tek11-recap</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Had a good week at 2011&#8217;s version of <a href='http://tek11.phparch.com/'>tek</a>. Thanks to <a href='http://blog.tabini.ca/'>Marco Tabini</a> and his whole crew for putting together another great conference this year. I haven&#8217;t professionally developed in PHP for several years now, but still consider this a must attend conference. This was my 4th year. The people and the content make it worth attending, even though I&#8217;m mostly doing Python work these days.</p>

<p>I gave two talks this year, both on Git. Both talks went well, but my advanced Git talk needs some tweaking so I can get it in at an hour. I always plan too much material when I first give it, so it needs a little more taken out.</p>

<p>As promised, I am going to get both talks online over the next week. Each of the repositories we walked through in the advanced talk are going to be posted to GitHub in their &#8220;before&#8221; state that you can play with them. They also include <code>README</code> files that explain what you&#8217;re doing and how to do it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already posted my <a href='https://github.com/tswicegood/pres.amending-commits'>amending</a> and <a href='https://github.com/tswicegood/pres.rebasing'>rebasing</a> repositories. You can search <a href='https://github.com/tswicegood/'>my github</a> for <code>pres.</code> to see all of the repositories. I&#8217;ll post again once I have them all up.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting evenings this year was a late-night hackathon that involved two 5 gallon kegs from <a href='http://blog.casey-sweat.us/'>Jason Sweat&#8217;s</a> personal stash. I went to bed early&#8217;ish, but got this image emailed to me around 1:30. I&#8217;m told whiskey fueled its creation. :-)</p>

        <updated>2011-05-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2011/05/04/tag-feeds</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weekends ago I quietly rolled out a new feature that people have been clamoring for here at TravisSwicegood.com. Feeds for tags. So say you&#8217;re only interested in following my <a href='/tags/personal/'>personal</a> posts, you can add that tag page to your favorite RSS reader to subscribe to it.</p>

<p>Or if you&#8217;re geeky, you might want to subscribe to my <a href='/tags/armstrong/'>armstrong</a> feed but don&#8217;t like the automagical discovery. In that case, just add <code>/atom/</code> to the end of the URL and you&#8217;ve got your RSS feed.</p>

<p>Ok, time to fess up. Nobody&#8217;s actually asked for it, but since moving over to the new site last year I&#8217;ve only had one feed. It&#8217;s been a sore spot and I&#8217;ve censored myself on my blog feeling I need to keep it cohesive. Screw that now.</p>]]></content>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2011/04/26/iterm2-and-xterm-256colors</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working on setting up a new (old) MacBook Pro this evening when I came across an oddity. Colors in <a href='http://www.iterm2.com/'>iTerm2</a> were working, but not in <code>xterm-256color</code> mode. Both laptops are sitting on the table next to each other, so I started debugging.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s all manner of bugs that have been reported, but no amount of tweaking my environment variables worked. Some time during the process, Xcode 3 finished installing and all of the sudden things started working.</p>

<p>My guess is that Xcode ships with X11 which is needed for <code>xterm-256color</code> to work, although I&#8217;m not planning on uninstalling just to see if it works. At any rate, if you&#8217;re having issues with 256-color mode in iTerm2, check to make sure you have Xcode installed.</p>]]></content>

        <title>Twitter Timeout</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2011/04/24/twitter-timeout/"/>
        <updated>2011-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2011/04/24/twitter-timeout</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I got a lot of responses to the following tweet:</p>
<div style='width:498px; margin:0 auto;'>
<img src='https://img.skitch.com/20110425-x25u1r64n4emja5dcywp11y6qw.png' alt='twitter-timeout' />
</div>
<p>As I write this post, Twitter&#8217;s ever-unreliable updates counter is showing that I have 9,999 tweets. It&#8217;s time for a Twitter Timeout.</p>

<p>Why? I&#8217;ve found myself thinking too quickly, without depth, mostly in the form of 140 characters. I want to get back to my place, my blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of playing in other people&#8217;s backyards, as it were. A large part of my interactions with the world are through Twitter and Facebook, two things I don&#8217;t own. My blog, my email. Those are mine. Until the Internet gives way to some bastardization of itself in the name of safety, security, or the God-forsaken &#8220;user experience,&#8221; it will always be mine to give and not at the control of some private entity.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m shuttering my Twitter account for a little while. I&#8217;m not sure how long, but I won&#8217;t be responding to any tweets or reading Twitter for a little while.</p>

<p>My contact information is amazingly public (it&#8217;s in the sidebar), so there&#8217;s no shortage of ways to get in touch with me. Feel free to.</p>]]></content>

        <title>On Writing</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/12/15/on-writing/"/>
        <updated>2010-12-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/12/15/on-writing</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past November I participated in the <a href='http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/190'>PragProWriMo</a>. For those familiar with the <a href='http://www.nanowrimo.org/'>NaNoWriMo</a>, the concept is similar. Commit to writing on a technical book every single day for the entire month of November.</p>

<p>I had been kicking around the idea of writing a book on <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a> and decided to use this as an opportunity to see what I had to say on the topic. Turns out that I had about a hundred and fifty pages worth of material.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m lucky enough that Pragmatic has agreed to pick up the book, so I&#8217;ve got a solid base to build out the tentatively titled Programming Node.js. This post isn&#8217;t a book announcement though, it&#8217;s about the process.</p>

<h2 id='why_i_did_it'>Why I did it</h2>

<p>This past month was mostly for my own benefit. I was certain I could get into a rhythm and turn out a lot of material. My <a href='http://pragprog.com/titles/pg_git/pragmatic-guide-to-git'>last book</a> took a lot longer than I originally planned and came really close to not happening.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not the first author to find himself behind schedule and feeling like there&#8217;s no way out, but it was the first time it happened to me. PragProWriMo was my chance to prove to myself that I could get some serious writing in.</p>

<h2 id='lessons_learned'>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve got three big take aways from this experience. First, the power of doing first, then talking about it. Second, the power of periodization in sports applies to mental tasks. Third, streaks are powerful incentives.</p>

<h3 id='actions_build_more_than_words'>Actions build more than words</h3>

<p>Earlier this fall I watched <a href='http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html'>this talk</a> at Ted from <a href='http://sivers.org/'>Derek Sivers</a> about goals. The gist is that you shouldn&#8217;t talk up you idea, you should just do it.</p>

<p>Studies seems to show that you get the same mental reward from talking about your goals as you do for actually achieving it. I&#8217;ve had plenty of ideas fall flat after really talking them up, so I decided to try this tactic and see how it panned out.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t talk about it at all. I participated daily on the <a href='http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/190'>forums</a> posting updates at where I was in the process. I did make sure to not talk about what I was doing though, it was just the end result.</p>

<p>I never made any grand announcement though. There was no blog post claiming I was going to write every day of the month or that I&#8217;d finish the month well over half way through a <a href='http://buddha-rat.squarespace.com/shitty-first-drafts/'>shitty first draft</a>. I just did it.</p>

<h3 id='periodization_its_for_more_than_sports'>Periodization: it&#8217;s for more than sports</h3>

<p>The second lesson was more subtle, but obvious to me in retrospect. I could have written more on any given day than I did. I ended just about every day midstream, but that was fine. I left those ideas sitting there waiting to be explained.</p>

<p>Picking up where I left off was easy. There was no need to figure out what was next. I didn&#8217;t have to ramp up and there was no fighting that feeling of being spent. Like I said, this is obvious with the benefit of hindsight. It&#8217;s one of the core principles of training.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know me that well, I used to be a pretty competitive mountain biker. I spent a few years racing and one of those was spent all over the southwest racing at national events. I wasn&#8217;t amazing. I was consistent and faster than a lot of people, but I dove into the process of training. I picked it apart, tried to understand everything, and came away with what I believe is a pretty solid understanding of the fundamentals that underly training as an endurance athlete.</p>

<p>One of the main principles is that you never want to leave it all out on the trail unless it&#8217;s a race. You want to end each day with something left in the tank. It&#8217;s counterintuitive at first, but the reason is simple. You&#8217;ve got to ride tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day.</p>

<p>You get faster by slowly ramping up the pace and the miles, and rarely draining yourself down to zero. You can&#8217;t recover quickly enough to get the next ride in when you do that.</p>

<p>I made a conscious decision to limit myself to two <a href='http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/'>pomodoros</a> a day, or roughly an hour of time dedicated to nothing but writing. Keeping the commitment small was key to my success. It kept me from getting burned out and ensured that I was still enjoying the process every day without over doing it.</p>

<h3 id='keep_it_going'>Keep it going</h3>

<p>The final piece is the streak. Today marks the 42 straight day that I&#8217;ve written or worked on my book. I&#8217;ve spent the past few days converting it from ReStructured Text over to Pragmatic&#8217;s internal markup, but I count those as days of work.</p>

<p>I probably could have spent a few hours over the weekend and knocked it all out in one sitting, but I wanted to keep a steady pace so I could keep the streak up. Today marks the 42nd straight day I&#8217;ve worked on the book and now that I&#8217;ve stretched it out this far I don&#8217;t want to <a href='http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret'>see it go away</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing here is new, though. These are all things that other people have figured out before me. This November simply put these things into sharp focus for me and the end result is that I&#8217;m half way through a book on a tool I thoroughly enjoy using and think more people need to know about.</p>

<p>For the record, I did miss one day in November. I didn&#8217;t write the day I gave my Pragmatic Guide to Git talk at Zendcon. I figure giving a talk is a good enough excuse for missing a day.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I talk with a lot of people about NoSQL. I&#8217;ve been following it pretty closely for about 3 years now. One of the things I often tell people who are trying to wrap their heads around the concepts of NoSQL and what all of the data stores mean is to go search for <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/justinsheehy'>Justin Sheehy</a> and his <a href='https://nosqleast.com/2009/#speaker/sheehy'>NoSQL East Talk</a>.</p>

<p>Then it dawned on me, why don&#8217;t I just embed the video on my site? Makes it super easy for people to find (<a href='http://travisswicegood.com/tags/riak'>travisswicegood.com/tags/riak</a>) and I don&#8217;t have to go searching for it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that I&#8217;ve accepted the senior position on the tech team at the <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/'>Texas Tribune</a>, a policy and politics news outfit based out of Austin, Texas. I&#8217;m helping them round out their internal tools and data processing starting next week (the 11th to be precise).</p>

<p>This means some big changes for me and my family. First, I&#8217;m moving to Austin. I love Lawrence, the quirky little town that it is, but it&#8217;s time for a change. Austin was high on the list of other places to consider (great cycling, big tech community, cool vibe, etc., etc.) so when this opportunity came up I had to take it.</p>

<p>The move is complicated by virtue of owning a house. For the first six months or so we&#8217;re going to split the house &#8211; me in Austin and Meg in Lawrence. I&#8217;ll be spending a week or so a month working from Lawrence so I can help finish up some of the random project on the house that we want to finish before we attempt to sell it. This works perfect with the Lawrence real estate market which peaks in April every year.</p>

<h2 id='what_happens_to_domain51'>What happens to Domain51?</h2>

<p>One question I&#8217;ve gotten repeatedly is what happens to <a href='http://domain51.com/'>Domain51</a>? Well, nothing in particular. I&#8217;ve spent the last 5 months or so winding it down in preparation for a transition of some sort. Until recently, I didn&#8217;t know exactly what that transition was going to be, but I&#8217;ve setup all of my former employees on their own adventures and wrapped up the work for existing clients. So it will go back to being my placeholder for any random consulting I do and the legal owner of all of my personal code copyrights.</p>

<h2 id='what_about_lawrence'>What about Lawrence?</h2>

<p>Lawrence is one of the coolest places I&#8217;ve lived. While writing this post I realized that it&#8217;s the place I&#8217;ve called home more than any other place since I left El Paso years ago.</p>

<p>There are tons of great people here, the culture is great, the weather isn&#8217;t half bad (though 2010 hasn&#8217;t puts its best foot forward), and it has some of the best food in the world if you&#8217;re a vegetarian. I am truly going to miss this town and everyone in it.</p>

<h2 id='isnt_journalism_dead'>Isn&#8217;t journalism dead?</h2>

<p>Yup, that&#8217;s what is so exciting about the Tribune. They&#8217;re trying a different model, and helping them make it successful could set the tone for how journalism copes with the seismic forces that are causing it so much change.</p>

<p>The Tribune is adopting what I call the NPR approach to journalism. They&#8217;re organized as a non-profit. You don&#8217;t subscribe to a paper or some such, you become a supporting member of it. Interested in politics and policy in Texas? Then you need to <a href='https://www.texastribune.org/support-us/'>visit this</a> page for more information about how you can support them.</p>

<p>I am really excited about this move. It&#8217;s the meshing of the past year&#8217;s work in non-profits and politics into one gig in an industry that is in the mist of a massive shift. How could I not want to be in the middle of that?</p>]]></content>

        <title>Pragmatic Guide to Git</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/25/pragmatic-guide-to-git/"/>
        <updated>2010-08-25T10:30:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/25/pragmatic-guide-to-git</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My latest book on Git, <a href='http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pg_git/pragmatic-guide-to-git'>Pragmatic Guide to Git</a> goes on sale today! I&#8217;m really excited about this new book. It&#8217;s the culmination of a year&#8217;s worth of work on an entirely new format for <a href='http://www.pragprog.com/'>Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href='http://media.pragprog.com/newsletters/2010-08-25.html'>today&#8217;s announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last summer, Pragmatic author Travis Swicegood proposed a new kind of book covering the popular version control system, Git. We thought it was a good idea&#8211;so much so that we’ve launched a whole new series in this format. Check out the details on the series below, as well as Travis’ new book, Pragmatic Guide to Git, now available <a href='http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pg_git/pragmatic-guide-to-git'>in beta</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having a good idea is cool. Having a good idea that you can get other people excited about too is even better. I thought I was onto something interesting when I pitched the idea to Prag, and so did everyone else there. A year later and here we are with an entire <a href='http://www.pragprog.com/pragmatic-guide-series'>new series</a> lined up.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the quick description of the new book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Need to learn how to wrap your head around Git, but don’t need a lot of hand holding? Grab this book if you’re new to Git, not to the world of programming. Git tasks displayed on two-page spreads provide all the context you need, without the extra fluff.</p>

        <title>Razors and Development</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/24/razors-and-development/"/>
        <updated>2010-08-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/24/razors-and-development</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I switched to an old fashion safety razor and haven&#8217;t looked back. The latest entry into the razor market has reaffirmed my decision as the right one.</p>

<p>The new <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003983HRI/'>Pro Glide</a> from Gillette only costs less than $10 to purchase. Good deal, right? Nope. The replacement blades cost $3-$4 each! Assuming you get a few weeks out of each blade, you&#8217;re looking at paying between $6 and $10 every month to use this razor blade.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great deal&#8212;for Gillette.</p>

<p>I use <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0028FNNI6/'>Merkur razor</a>. I paid a lot, comparatively speaking, up front but I can buy better quality razors for less than $0.75 each. They last a lot longer and I end up with a much better shave.</p>

<p>I view the trade-off here as the same one you have to look at when deciding what framework you choose to develop your code in. There are a lot of frameworks that provide a lot of help getting off of the ground. It almost seems too easy.</p>

<p>Write your on custom blog in 5 minutes? Sure! Want to have a RESTful API? Add a couple of classes, some new routes, mark as complete.</p>

<p>Look at the framework and read some of the comments from its detractors. Those complaining generally have one of two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>They&#8217;re going to complain about anything, they&#8217;re just ranting. Ignore these people.</li>

<li>They&#8217;ve hit a legitimate pain point in the framework where they deviated too far from the intended use. Pay attention to what these people are talking about.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#8217;re application is significantly complex, no off-the-shelf framework is going to do everything you need it to. Some frameworks may even get in the way. Make sure you realize the trade-offs before you commit.</p>

<h3 id='what_makes_a_good_framework'>What makes a good framework?</h3>

<p>The best ones serve as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding'>scaffolding</a>&#8212;in the original meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; a temporary structure used to support people and material in the construction or repair of buildings and other large structures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put another way for software development:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; helps you ramp up quickly, then gets out of the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, frameworks manage the first part of this well. That&#8217;s where they shine. It&#8217;s the last part that they&#8217;ve had a problem with.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django</a> manages both of these well. My one complaint with it is that it manages the latter part better than the first. There&#8217;s a lot of boilerplate needed to get started, but I can live with that. When my applications outgrow Django, removing Django from the equation is easy with one exception.</p>

<p>Models.</p>

<p>Models are like your razor&#8217;s blades. Without blades, your razor doesn&#8217;t shave; without models your application doesn&#8217;t have any data to work with. The fix I&#8217;ve found works best for me is to keep my models then and put all of my logic for operating on them in other areas of the code base.</p>

<p>This separation helps me keep my business logic portable. I might be using the cheap route to get started, but the heavy lifting goes with me if I decide something else is a better fit.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/11/waxing-poetic/"/>
        <updated>2010-08-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/11/waxing-poetic</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday (essentially), I woke up and decide to stir the pot a little bit. I had come across <a href='http://developmentseed.org/jobs'>this post</a> while looking into the company behind <a href='http://mapbox.com/'>MapBox</a>. As I noted, I do this to get a feel for what the company is doing. What technology is important to them? What do they value? Are they funded, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>That particular job posting rubbed me the wrong way, however, because of it&#8217;s emphatic no telecommute policy, with them going so far as to call attention to it with a bold font. To automatically shut the door to any potential employee who might be an amazing fit, just not in their particular office seems extremely one-sided.</p>

<p>I woke up ready to write, and did. Before <a href='http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/'>writing my first book</a>, my post would have been rather mellow. I would have presented the case, but not gone quite so far in making my case. This post, I decided to let it rip. Companies that didn&#8217;t allow telecommuting don&#8217;t get it, end of discussion.</p>

<p>And boy did it work. Nearly 90 comments&#8212;between Hacker News and my blog&#8212;later, I&#8217;m still amazed at the fervor with which both sides attacked the issue. Almost to a T, no one was in the middle on this. Everyone had an opinion. They loved it, or they hated it. Everything from management types saying how their teams wouldn&#8217;t be the same if IRC was their only interaction to people with severe social anxiety talking about how telecommuting affords them the opportunity to deal with that anxiety by focusing on their job, not their proximity to people.</p>

<p>I like to mine the edges of the conversation to get the bigger picture. My post emphasized the importance of taking a stand. Had I not been so opinionated, I doubt much interested would have been given to the post.</p>

<p>Honestly, the post is a little harsher than my personal opinion on the subject. Companies that start the conversation with prospective employees by outlining the things they aren&#8217;t going to stand for are starting off on the wrong foot, but beyond that I realize that telecommuting does present challenges in some environments and some companies&#8212;at their loss&#8212;aren&#8217;t willing to try to overcome those challenges.</p>

<p>A few months back a recruiter&#8212;the flaky kind it turns out&#8212;was talking with me about a gig. I was honest that I wasn&#8217;t looking to move, but for the right opportunity every thing was on the table. I told him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to be up front with you. I&#8217;m not looking to move, but I&#8217;m not ruling it out. All I ask for in return is that you approach this with the same open-mindedness. Let&#8217;s continue the process, see if its a good fit, then figure out if we can make the logistics work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, they didn&#8217;t. Companies, particularly in the tech space, are asking their potential employees to take a chance on them. Companies are taking a risk too, but when companies expect the employees to be the only ones giving (broadly disregarding monetary compensation from the companies for the moment), they set the wrong tone.</p>]]></content>

        <title>Telecommuting Culture</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/09/telecommuting-culture/"/>
        <updated>2010-08-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/09/telecommuting-culture</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years back, I&#8217;m not even sure when, I started looking at job postings of companies I found interesting. The point wasn&#8217;t to find a new job, but to understand the company a bit more.</p>

<p>You can almost always discover what technology a company is using if they&#8217;re hiring. I found out <a href='http://www.plurk.com/jobs'>Plurk uses Python</a> through this method, that <a href='http://twitter.com/positions.html'>Twitter hasn&#8217;t given up on Ruby</a>, and even when it doesn&#8217;t make sense <a href='http://developmentseed.org/jobs'>Washington DC shops still use Drupal</a>.</p>

<p>That last company is what gave rise to <a href='http://twitter.com/tswicegood/status/20666286855'>this tweet</a>:</p>
<div class='thumbnail skitch'>
<img src='http://img.skitch.com/20100809-gqy4dnfq5ukj2t12g3tjejyx29.preview.jpg' alt='The second I see "no telecommute" on a job posting, I make an immediate judgement of the company and its culture. It is never a good one.' /></div>
<p>They&#8217;re pretty blunt about telecommuting, actually. Going so far as to say &#8221;<span>i</span>t is <strong>not</strong> ok to telecommute.&#8221; The emphasis is theirs (as seen in <a href='http://skitch.com/tswicegood/dtdf8/job-posting-w-o-telecommute'>this Skitch</a>). This gives me a couple of possible explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>They&#8217;ve been burned in the past. They hired someone on who misrepresented himself, his abilities, his capacity, or all of the above. They feel that they gave it a try and it isn&#8217;t for them, so they&#8217;re not going down that road again. This is the most generous possibility.</li>

<li>They don&#8217;t have their heads screwed on right. They live in a &#8220;constantly evolving and fast-paced&#8221; environment (as seen on other job postings) which translates roughly into we can&#8217;t control our product team, our CEO, or worst, what our sales team promises, so you&#8217;re going to have to sit by and wait for the hour-by-hour priorities. Communicating them by any other means than directly from our mouth to your ass, sitting at a desk waiting to turn our ideas into money via that magical electronic device in front of you is too inefficient.</li>

<li>A slight variation of the previous option is that they lack the confidence in their abilities. They have the vision, the product specs are nailed down, but they don&#8217;t know if they can convey them without &#8220;reading&#8221; the other person.</li>

<li>Finally, the last possible option is that they&#8217;re so out of touch with reality that they believe the only way for work to be done is with &#8220;asses in seats.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these options, shy away&#8212;no, run, very quickly, away from the 2nd and 4th. Those companies don&#8217;t get it. The other two provide some hope, it&#8217;s up to as to whether to stick around (or start) and find out.</p>

<p>Companies that don&#8217;t allow telecommuting, especially companies that are up front about it, don&#8217;t get it. Telecommuting is no longer a technical challenge. Reliable high-speed Internet is ubiquitous at this point. I can see adding that as a requirement to a job posting, but not where you&#8217;re located.</p>

<p>With the technical out of the way, that leaves only the social aspect of the company and the position they&#8217;re hiring for. I get the culture that requires someone on site. I also realize I&#8217;m not interested in working for a company with that culture.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the culture that specs and requirements are fluid based on the latest hallway session. It says interruptions are a part of the day that you should be used to&#8212;we like to chat a lot. It&#8217;s the we don&#8217;t have any realistic metrics to use to judge your performance, so we can only know if you&#8217;re doing work by whether or not you show up. That last one <a href='http://scottyblog.blip.tv/'>has worked so well in the past</a>.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s a big place. There&#8217;s a lot of developers in it. There&#8217;s even a few kick ass ones. Most of those don&#8217;t live near you&#8212;even if &#8220;this position is located at our <em>offices</em> in Palo Alto,&#8221; which is another euphemism for no telecommute. By being up front about telecommuting not being and option, you&#8217;re telling me that company comes first (we go to the mountain). Hiring someone good is important, but hiring the best you can afford isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>A company that doesn&#8217;t go out of its way to build the best team possible, regardless of where they&#8217;re located, isn&#8217;t a company I want to work for. It&#8217;s a matter of priorities. I&#8217;ve got mine straight, they don&#8217;t have theirs.</p>]]></content>

        <title>Critical Thinking</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/06/critical-thinking/"/>
        <updated>2010-08-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/08/06/critical-thinking</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By now, I hope we&#8217;ve all read <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/'>Is Google Making Us Stupid</a> from <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/'>The Atlantic</a>. Here&#8217;s the quick version, which ironically makes the author&#8217;s point:</p>

<p>People are changing the way they interact with the world, which is changing the way their brains model the world, which is changing their brains. We&#8217;re not exercising the critical, reflective part of our brains; instead, we&#8217;re using almost exclusively the parts that focus on quick, immediate activities. We&#8217;re skimming everything rather than thinking more critically, more reflectively.</p>

<p>The reaction to the <a href='http://www.naacp.org/news/entry/video_sherrod/'>Shirley Sherrod</a> case is an excellent example of this. Rather than step back, the <a href='http://www.naacp.org/'>NAACP</a> and <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov'>White House</a> jumped on it and stepped in the heaping pile of burning feces that was laid at their doorstep.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s this got to do with <em>thinking</em> and Twitter and such? Well, it&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve started blogging again. I don&#8217;t want to lose my ability, what little it sometimes appears to be, of critical thinking and reasoning so I&#8217;m starting to blog more.</p>

<p>I noticed my thought process was becoming much more reactionary and shallow. I was allowing the insignificant to bubble up and take over. Rather than ponder something and try to write out, I was firing off a quick tweet and calling it a day. Couldn&#8217;t fit it in a tweet? Oh well, it must not be <em>that</em> important.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m coming back to blogging. The first four years I ran this blog, I had over 100 posts each year&#8212;closing in on 200 in 2006. Starting in 2008, however, I let it slide. 66, 22, and then only 13 posts so far this year. I&#8217;m working on reversing that trend.</p>]]></content>

<p>Ruby is too clever, I can never figure out what&#8217;s going on or what to expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Python developer&#8217;s can&#8217;t write a test to save their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>PHP developers, well, do I really need to say more?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone&#8217;s moaning, from the top to the bottom about something with software. To listen to them, you&#8217;d think we had no tools to do anything and that all software sucked.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got news for you. It all does, so can we please move on now?</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a new concept. Actually, I&#8217;m stealing it mostly from <a href='http://chriswanstrath.com/'>Chris</a> and his keynote as <a href='http://rubymidwest.com/'>Ruby Midwest</a>, but I&#8217;m coming at it from a slightly different point of view.</p>

<p>I had the unfortunate task of talking with a client today about the state of their code and recommending that they put a few small tweaks on hold until a larger revisiting could happen. Ultimately, it&#8217;s their decision and I&#8217;ll do what they want, but it&#8217;s going to cost them more for what can only be a temporary solution now, versus revisiting it in a few months as part of a larger redesign.</p>

<p>Why? Because their current code <em>sucks</em>. Everything is hard coded&#8212;nary a loop in sight. There&#8217;s HTML mixed up in their business logic and business logic in their HTML. They have a haphazard layout to their project. Form validation? They got it. To the tune of <code>if</code> statements in functions that are hundreds of lines line. Touching one part invariably breaks two other parts because they depended on that particular HTML tag to exist in that particular place, with those types of siblings, etc. etc., etc.</p>

<p>This code is the definition of spaghetti code. Adding features that are less than 30 minutes on any normal project are taking upwards of 5 to 6 hours, most of it in testing and fixes for other things you break along the way.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m relatively new to the project and wasn&#8217;t brought on in a code review capacity. I was explaining my reasoning and a knowing grin came across their face. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been told that most developers hate projects that they come into when they&#8217;re new to it because they didn&#8217;t code it. It&#8217;s not how they would have done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gee, thanks. Every single developer out there who&#8217;s complained because someone used a different bracing system or they used a different naming convention than they would have or any one of the hundreds (if not thousands) of other asinine things coders like to complain about make it impossible for me to convey to a new client that his code truly is in need of some serious help because &#8220;developers hate projects.&#8221;</p>

<h3 id='can_we_all_please_shut_up'>Can we all please shut up?</h3>

<p>My point is this. Code sucks. It&#8217;s all a compromise to take an idea that we (or our clients) have formed and turn it into something machines can understand. It&#8217;s all trade offs. There&#8217;s always another way to approach something, a different language it could be written in, a more scalable data back end that could have been used. <em>Always</em>.</p>

<p>So why spend time talking about it? All we&#8217;re doing is making it easier for the people who need to be listening to us to tune us out. They don&#8217;t know the difference someone like me complaining about the internal structure of <a href='http://wordpress.org/'>Wordpress</a> (which I think is an abomination) and my explaining that it is the wrong choice for their project (which I&#8217;d argue is the case for at least half of business deployments of WP). That&#8217;s not their job to known and understand the difference, but it is ours. It&#8217;s also our job to be able to convey that information to them.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a few tweets from <a href='http://www.jansch.nl/'>Ivo</a> (if I recall correctly) during <a href='http://confoo.ca/en'>Confoo</a>. One of the speakers had tweeted about the wifi and issues they were having with it. Then a bunch of people started &#8220;me too&#8221; tweeting about how bad it was and Ivo called the original person out on it. What good did it do for a speaker to complain publicly about a situation that was already known (and being worked on, I might add) other than to encourage everyone else to follow suit?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re doing the same thing every time we bitch and moan about relatively insignificant things in code. We&#8217;re doing everyone a disservice by increasing the noise-to-signal ratio when we complain for no good reason. So please, let&#8217;s all put a sock in it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m lazy when it comes to code. Not in a bad way, but in an efficient way. I want to get to the crux of the matter quickly and move on. Truth be told, that&#8217;s why I like TDD&#8212;I don&#8217;t have to remember anything more than I need to know right now. My tests remember everything else I knew, but I digress.</p>

<p>When I start evaluating a new library to see if its something I want to use, code is what I want to see. Sure, tell me what it does, briefly, then move into the basic use-case. As an example, <a href='http://skitch.com/tswicegood/dxty9/ruby-programming-language'>consider the front page of Ruby-Lang.org</a>.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve got access to all the information you need, but right up front and center (almost literally) is some code showing you how to use Ruby.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re starting a new library, make sure to put the code right up front. I know there are any number of projects I have on <a href='http://github.com/tswicegood/'>GitHub</a> that fail this test, but I&#8217;m not out purchasing domain names and designing custom sites for my projects either. If you bill your project as &#8220;easy&#8221; and &#8220;powerful&#8221;, show me, don&#8217;t tell me.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you&#8217;re no better than <a href='http://www.travisswicegood.com/2009/10/18/john-deere-and-iphones/'>the phone commercials</a>]<span /> that promise the world will bow before me if only I use their phone, without, you know, showing their phone being used.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally got around to converting some old code from SVN to Git and getting it up on <a href='http://github.com/'>GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s like looking back through a time-warp actually, as most of the code hasn&#8217;t been touched since the summer of 2007.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the code is usable, but it&#8217;s all abandoned at this point. If there&#8217;s something there that strikes your fancy and you&#8217;d be interested in forking it into your own project, feel free.</p>

<p>There are still a few more to go, but you can start checking them out now at the <a href='http://github.com/domain51/'>Domain51 Github account</a>.

        <title>Real-life global hell</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/07/24/real-life-global-hell/"/>
        <updated>2010-07-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/07/24/real-life-global-hell</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been playing with testing frameworks all over the spectrum of languages. I&#8217;ve come to really enjoy using <a href='http://cukes.info'>Cucumber</a> for testing web APIs. Since most of my coding lately has been in JavaScript or Python, using Ruby with Cucumber allows me to completely segregate my tests from the system under test (SUT). This separation has worked great until recently when I needed to have the test system running in Python.</p>

<p>I started looking at the Python bridge in Cucumber and that&#8217;s when I came across <a href='http://lettuce.it/'>Lettuce</a>. It&#8217;s a Cucumber-inspired, Python <abbr title='behavior
driven development'>BDD</abbr> library. I like the syntax, it had built in Django support, tons of tests (including functional and integration), so I was ready to go.</p>

<p>Then I ran the test suite. And it failed.</p>

<p>A failing test suite is a massive red-flag for me with any project. In a test suite, it&#8217;s a nuclear launch siren. I poked around a bit and figured out what was triggering the test, but not why, <a href='http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce/issues/52'>opened a bug report</a> and found out that the tests were never meant to be run together.</p>

<p>I let it go, but last weekend decided I was going to dig into the framework, figure out what was causing the tests to fail if the functional tests were run before the unit tests, and submit a patch.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of Sunday afternoon cursing at code, trying various paths of exploration, trying to grok the entire framework&#8217;s codebase to understand what was happening. I ended up going so far as doing the equivalent of <code>var_dump()</code> debugging (pdb didn&#8217;t prove very helpful because of the intense setup required before the tests started running)</p>

<p>Finding the code that was causing the problem was easy - modifications to the <code>lettuce.registry.STEP_REGISTRY</code> were causing the failure. Figuring out how to fix that proved more difficult.</p>

<p>The issue, it turned out, was global state. The unit tests assumed that once they setup, the state wouldn&#8217;t change. The functional tests didn&#8217;t much care for that and stomped all over the registry of steps. By the time the unit tests rolled around, the steps that were so carefully defined inside the unit test modules were no gone and the test suite was throwing failures.</p>

<p>I finally <a href='http://github.com/tswicegood/lettuce/commit/7f6e852febed135fd5d15081facdfa05c8010823'>landed on the solution</a> by redefining all of the steps inside a <code>@with_setup()</code> for the tests that need them in the unit tests. It brings up a couple of interesting learning moments.</p>

<p>First, this shows the need to make no assumptions when writing tests. Need a database connection? Make sure its initialized and ready for each test that uses it. Want to make sure a step is defined for the test your checking in a BDD framework, define it immediately before running the test. It&#8217;s a good example of defensive coding.</p>

<p>Second, it shows the mess that global state can create. Each of the test modules was being loaded by <a href='http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/'>nose</a>, then the tests were being executed after a global state (the <code>STEP_REGISTRY</code> object) was defined. When other tests changed that state, things started falsely failing.</p>

<p>The &#8220;fix&#8221; currently is to reset that state to what you expect every time, but this causes issues with tests running in parallel. What happens when two of the same tests both try to reset the state at the same time? Don&#8217;t know, I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I imagine it&#8217;s gonna cause some more failures.</p>

<p>My fix now is short-term (and <a href='http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce/commit/0bf1f87115567648eecbe601c66217e39d6a9178'>was included</a>) and it gets the job done. Hopefully, this shows you a bit about what we mean when developers say that global state is a bad thing that leads to tricky bugs that are hard to comprehend. In this case, I literally had to understand the entire step definition system in order to comprehend what was happening here</p>

<p>The test cases at least gave me some guard rails to help guide me toward the solution, but had there not be global state in the first place, these tests would have worked across the board with no problems.</p>]]></content>

        <title>Using Twitter OAuth Properly</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/07/07/using-twitter-oauth-properly/"/>
        <updated>2010-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/07/07/using-twitter-oauth-properly</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is it.  I've had enough!  Seriously, people.  OAuth is about maintaining control as a user and everyone wants me to give it up!  I'm tired of constantly clicking deny.</p>

<p>What am I complaining about?  The constant abuse of Twitter OAuth login.  Every site that I've visited that uses Twitter OAuth requires both read <em>and</em> write access to my account.  The latest to do this is <a href="http://paper.li">Paper.li</a>, a service that looks really cool,<br />
but&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4771773793_646833d20b.jpg"
     alt="OAuth requiring update permissions just for login" /></p>


<p>So what's the fix?  Websites should ask for the minimum amount of information needed to get started.  In nearly every single case, the sites are using it for login purposes.  Instead of a username and password, you talk to Twitter to verify that you have a legitimate user.  Those "Tweet This For Me" buttons are optional add-ons that you can do.</p>

<p>You should handle those automatic cases by performing an upgrade when the user decides they want to allow your application to update for them.  Unfortunately, Twitter doesn't allow you to specify which level of access you want when you request a token, you have to do it when you setup your application.</p>

<p>Registering two applications is an easy solution to this problem.  You use the read-only application for authentication, then switch to the other app when you're attempting to write.  It requires a little overhead when you store the authentication token, but it's trivial to store a flag showing which set of credentials to use.</p>

<p>Honestly, I know <em>most</em> applications are completely trustworthy. Especially those I've found through recommendations of others, but it's still unnerving to give 100% access to my account to a new service for the shear pleasure of being able to login and see if I like it.  It should be to you too.</p>

        <title>MongoDB: A first look</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/05/31/mongodb-a-first-look/"/>
        <updated>2010-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/05/31/mongodb-a-first-look</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The entire subject of two talks and mentioned in several other, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> was
definitely a buzz at <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">TekX</a> this year.  It's long been in favor in the tech
community in Lawrence and has been used for some data crunching for a few
projects at the local paper.  Even with all of this exposure, I've yet to sit
down and actually explore it.</p>
<p>That changed Friday afternoon while I sat at O'Hare waiting on my flight back
to Lawrence (which subsequently got canceled).  I installed Mongo earlier in
the week and opened up a bunch of tabs on the various intros and tutorials
available on the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">Mongo wiki</a>.  The rest of this article a mix of
stream-of-conscious as I played around with Mongo for the first time and some
of my reflections this past week.</p>
<h4>Note on typefaces</h4>
<p>I use both Mongo and <code>mongo</code> throughout this article.  The first, the
title-case Mongo refers to the software as a whole.  Whenever you see <code>mongo</code>
with a lowercase and in <code>monospace</code>, it's referring to the Mongo client program
you run from the command line.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>On a Mac, it's a breeze.  I use <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> to manage software on my Mac, so a
quick <code>brew install mongodb</code> was all I needed and a minute later I was ready to
go.</p>
<h3>Starting Up the Server</h3>
<p>Mongo is run by the <code>mongod</code> process.  I don't know if it's pronounced
<em>mongo-d</em> or <em>mon-god</em> though.  It's a fun play on words if the latter is the
case.</p>
<p>Brew includes a basic configuration to get up and running, so I use that inside
a <code>screen</code> instance so I can leave it running in the background while I use the
<code>mongo</code> tool to interact with it.</p>
<h3>Interacting with Mongo</h3>
<p>I started out with the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Tutorial">basic tutorial</a> to get going.  It looks like that
needs some love though.  It shows the version in the startup as 0.9.8.
Homebrew ships with 1.4.2 and I did find a few things that were out of date.
No, I' haven't been a good open source community member and submitted fixes
yet.</p>
<p>The first thing that's different than a traditional RMDBS with Mongo is that
you don't have to explicitly create a database.  Pretty straight forward: from
within <code>mongo</code>, type <code>use &lt;database&gt;</code>.  This creates a brand new database for
you and you're off.  For the examples below, I'm using <code>use mydb</code> to select
<code>mydb</code> as my database.</p>
<p>It's kind of nice to just be able to connect and go, but it feels odd.  Not
good or bad, just odd.  Sort of like the first time you run <code>git checkout</code>
inside a repository to switch branches when you're used to Subversion.</p>
<p>The shell feels like a Javascript console.  I don't have access to the source
code in my off-line mode, so I don't know but that it is.  The syntax seems
remarkably similar, so it's at least Javascript inspired.</p>
<h3>Adding Records</h3>
<p>Mongo stores documents, not rows of columns.  This distinction allows Mongo to
ignore schema&mdash;continuing the theme of leaving it up to the developer.
Those documents can be made up any number key-values that look remarkably like
JSON.  Need to store a new data point, just add it as a field to a document
and you're set.</p>
<p>Here's an example inspired by Mongo's tutorial for adding a few records:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; person = {name: "Travis Swicegood"}
&gt; city = {city: "Lawrence", state: "KS"}
&gt; db.things.save(person)
&gt; db.things.save(city)
</code></pre>
<p>Here I created two new objects with various data attached to them, then saved
them all inside the <code>things</code> collection.  Collections in Mongo are like a table
inside the SQL world.  You don't have to create a collection, you just declare
it on the <code>db</code> object, and you're set.</p>
<p>Comparing this to the same code in a database, I've got to say I love this.  No
boilerplate code to get going.  I didn't have to create a database, no tables
were created.  I just started using them.  This appeals to my
laziness&mdash;err, I mean desire for efficiency, but also looks very promising
to teach someone new.  Every abstract idea you can remove is one less potential
stumbling block for someone starting out.</p>
<p>Back to the data I entered.  Notice that neither have the same fields.
Collections inside Mongo are made up of a series of keys and values&mdash;they
can be whatever you want them to be.  This is perfect for lazy migrations:
migrating the data as its requested instead of doing it all at once.  <a href="http://merciless.sourceforge.net/">ming</a>,
a Python wrapper around Mongo <a href="http://merciless.sourceforge.net/tour.html#specifying-a-migration">already provides this</a>.  This is especially
useful for large sites with lots of data that may or may not ever been
requested again.<br />
</p>
<h3>Finding Records</h3>
<p>Now that the records are there, finding them.  The <code>db.things</code> object comes
back now:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9a96b7d04f51b48499011"), "name" : "Travis Swicegood" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9a96f7d04f51b48499012"), "city" : "Lawrence", "state" : "KS" }
</code></pre>
<p>That gives me everything.  The <code>find</code> method takes optional parameters to
filter the results.  This is actually a good time to bring up the built-in help
in <code>mongo</code>.  Entering only the value of any function (i.e., without calling it)
displays the implementation of the function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find
function (query, fields, limit, skip) {
    return new DBQuery(
        this._mongo, this._db, this, this._fullName,
        this._massageObject(query), fields, limit, skip);
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> I changed the formatting so it's more easily viewable online.</p>
<p>The parameters are optional (like all Javascript function), so you can pass in
as many or as few as you want.  Filtering the results is done by providing a
hash for the <code>query</code> parameter (the first one).  For example, to find my
record:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find({name: "Travis Swicegood"})
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9a96b7d04f51b48499011"),
  "name" : "Travis Swicegood" }
</code></pre>
<p>One thing you can't do is full-text searching.  I can't ask for all of the
records that begin with <code>Travis</code> or have a portion of my name in it.  The
current recommendation (at least via the wiki) is to build your own list of
keywords as an array, then search that array.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; var person2 = {name: "Travis Swicegood",
&gt;                name_field: ["Travis", "Swicegood"]};
&gt; db.things.save(person2)
&gt; db.things.find({name_field: "Travis"})
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9afa17d04f51b48499014"),
  "name" : "Travis Swicegood", 
  "name_field" : [ "Travis", "Swicegood" ] }
</code></pre>
<p>For something like a name, this can be useful.  For full-text searching of an
article, it's probably best to delegate searching off to something like
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> and let Mongo focus on storage and retrieval.</p>
<h4>Querying for sub-objects</h4>
<p>Of course, I had to try sub-objects to see if they would work:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find({person: person2})
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9b02b7d04f51b48499015"), 
  "person" : { "name" : "Travis Swicegood",
               "name_field" : [ "Travis", "Swicegood" ],
               "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9afa17d04f51b48499014") },
  "city" : { "city" : "Lawrence",
             "state" : "KS",
             "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9a96f7d04f51b48499012") } }
</code></pre>
<p>You can also query using the dot-notation to &lquot;reach through&rquot; an
object and look at its children.  This returns the same result as the previous
query:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find({"person.name_field": "Travis"})
</code></pre>
<h4>Limiting returned columns</h4>
<p>This ability to dynamically add columns to a record and definitely provides a
breading ground for massive documents with lots of keys.  Most of the time a
small subset of those keys are all that's needed.  The second parameter in <code>find</code>
provides us with that functionality:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find({person: person2}, {city:1})  
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9b02b7d04f51b48499015"), 
  "city" : { "city" : "Lawrence",
             "state" : "KS",
             "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9a96f7d04f51b48499012") } }
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, you can reach through the object and pull out a subfield:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; db.things.find({person: person2}, {"city.state":1})
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4bf9b02b7d04f51b48499015"), 
  "city" : { "state" : "KS" } }
</code></pre>
<p>These examples bring up a syntax thing with Mongo that I'm not crazy about: the
use of the number one.  It's the standard C style: 1 is true, 0 is false.  I'd
love to see the client and the libraries adopt an intent revealing name.
Granted, this is a minor niggle, but the little things are what make a good
system an amazing one.</p>
<h3>Few issues</h3>
<p>The docs, being that they are community run and Mongo's still relatively new,
are a little loose.  I've found a bunch of examples looking through them that
don't work the way they were documented.</p>
<p>Another potential issue (or at least something you need to be aware of) is that
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing">Mongo's geospatial support</a> isn't 100% year.  They only provide 2d and the
math they use assumes that 1&deg; of longitude is the same at the poles as it is at
the equator.  For many applications, this isn't a <em>huge</em> issue, but if
precision is important, Mongo's not ready for this type of use.</p>
<p>One thing that I'm looking forward to is <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding">Mongo's sharding</a>.  That is going
to allow Mongo to scale horizontally really well.  Some of 
<a href="http://www.snailinaturtleneck.com/blog/2010/05/05/with-a-name-like-mongo-it-has-to-be-good/">the initial test results</a> look amazing.  What will be really interesting is
to see how well is scales down.  It's one thing to have over 300,000 ops/sec
on a bigger box, another thing to be able to manage it on something like a 1gb
instance on <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers">Rackspace Cloudservers</a>.</p>
<h3>Two Biggest Issues</h3>
<p>First, Mongo's a master-slave system.  It appears really robust, but whenever a
box takes on a special role I start to get nervous.  One of the promises of
&lquot;NoSQL&rquot; is that it provides a tremendous amount of resilience.  Any
time you start to add special nodes you're taking away from that.</p>
<p>For example, if you're running 5 homogeneous servers and one goes down, the
other 4 can pick up the slack&mdash;assuming you're not running 5 servers at
peak capacity.  This makes failure planning easy: figure up the amount of CPU
time you need to handle your load, provision that many servers, then add enough
servers to be comfortable when they start failing.  Need 3 servers, provision 5
and you can have two failures before you peg your machines.</p>
<p>This isn't to say Mongo can't handle failures.  It's current model is
rebalancing the load when one of the servers goes out.  <code>mongos</code> is the tool to
read up on for handling this.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to dive into
it yet.  The only way to know for sure is to build up a cluster then start
killing servers.  Of course, this type of testing is preferred for any data
storage system.</p>
<p>Second, the license.  I'm not anti-AGPL, but there's some ambiguity.  The Mongo
team has addressed this both on the
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Licensing">wiki</a> and through an in-depth
<a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/103832439/the-agpl">blog post</a>.  According to
that, I can write up a service such as <a href="https://mongohq.com/">MongoHQ</a> and as long as I don't
actually change the <code>mongod</code> or <code>mongos</code> code I'm fine.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most of the definitions I've read of the AGPL mean that code
that talks to it is subject to being hit with the AGPL.  I don't have any
doubts with <a href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a>, but if they don't always own the copyright&#133;</p>
<p>Of course, those last two paragraphs are with the caveat I am not a lawyer.</p>
<p>I think Mongo is an amazingly compelling piece of software in the non-standard
database realm.  With the upcoming sharding and what I would have to imagine is
an eminent fix to the geospatial queries, Mongo's definitely worth a look.</p>

<hr />
<p>It truly is a shame that <a href="http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/">so</a> <a href="http://www.akshayatrust.org/">many</a> <a href="http://watercredit.org/">amazing</a> <a href="http://www.chfinternational.org/">non</a>-<a href="http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/">profits</a> are hidden behind horribly thought out websites. &nbsp;Most of these sites deluge their visitors with information, even though great sites such as <a href="http://charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> exist to provide raw statistics and facts about non-profits. &nbsp;The problem is that most non-profits are missing the point. &nbsp;Their websites are there to tell a story.</p>
<p>Let me say it again: a non-profit's website is there to tell a story. &nbsp;Nothing else.</p>
<p>People are natural story tellers and are drawn to an authentic story. &nbsp;Each of the websites linked to above have an amazing story behind them just waiting to be unleashed. &nbsp;A story that engages their visitors and potential donors. &nbsp;A story that sticks with them while they navigate their life the next few days. &nbsp;A story that ends with another beginning. &nbsp;One the visitor is a part of&mdash;where they help chose the ending by getting involved and helping that non-profit reach its goals, whether those goals are getting girls back to school to defeat the spiral of poverty in East Africa; feeding the abandoned, mentally ill of India; or helping people afford water while lifting themselves out of poverty.</p>
<p>When I left <a href="http://ning.com/">Ning</a> a year ago this day I set out to figure out how I could increase my impact on the world. &nbsp;Through a series of&nbsp;fortuitous&nbsp;events, I ended up working with non-profits, helping them tell their story online. &nbsp;I need to make sure I remember that.</p>

        <title>Open Government in Kansas</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/02/11/open-government-in-kansas/"/>
        <updated>2010-02-11T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/02/11/open-government-in-kansas</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent an hour yesterday afternoon on a conference call organized by the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> about open government in Kansas. The Sunlight Foundation is an organization whose self-proclaimed mission is to use "cutting-edge technology and ideas to make government transparent and accountable." It was really encouraging to see the interest in open government, but there's lot's to be done.</p>

<p>We have some counties (<a href="http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Evaluation_of_Kansas_county_websites">20 according to the Sunshine Review</a>) that don't even have websites, much less accessible data about their governments. You can't make claims of openness when you're not even presenting basic information about yourself online.</p>

<p>There were also some issues with the Freedom of Information Act requests. The state has to respond within 3 days to tell you when they'll respond, but they haven't been extremely helpful and have even gone so far as to encourage people not to pester them. The old "more flys with honey than vinegar" argument.</p>

<p>One comment I heard in the conversation was an admonition from someone on the ground here in the state (I didn't catch the name) to watch shooting for the stars. He said he was tired of seeing data being hidden behind "well, we want to do this right" instead of just getting information out there. He was advocating scanning things like minutes and making them available that way. I applaud the release early, release often mentality of that approach, but as a tech guy, that scares me.</p>

<p>I want raw data. In my ideal world, I get an API key from the state and can query the databases of any branch of government and get the information that they're responsible for. Scanned JPGs don't give me that. I have to run an <abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> on the images and hope it's a font (or in some cases handwritting) that's recognizable by a computer to get any raw data out of it. Forget the semantics in it, those are almost completely lost without manually vetting all of the data.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a matter of people trying to hide data through obscurity, rather, I think it's more a matter of not fully understanding the issues here. How can you expect those 20 counties to understand the difference between "available" and "accessible" when they don't even think a website is important enough to maintain?</p>

<p>One thing that really makes today's conversation interesting, however, is the recent Secretary of State development. This past Monday, the <a href="http://www.kssos.org/other/news_releases/PR_2010/PR_020810.html">Kansas Secretary of State gave one week's notice</a> that he was resigning his post to pursue a career in the private sector.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State controls all of the public financial records for campaigns. Voter files, campaign contributions, expenditures, all of that is stored behind the firewall at the Secretary of State's office. There's information on the <a href="http://www.kssos.org/main.html">current site</a> about campaigns and the money they raised, but good luck finding it. I dare you. Give that site to someone who's Internet savvy but not familiar with the site and ask them to find the the filings for the Governor's race. I know my way around the site and it still took me 5 minutes to find it. Hint: it's burried under sub-links that are only exposed when you're on certain pages.</p>

<p>What would be amazing to see is someone appointed Secretary of State who gets open government. Who realizes that <a href="http://www.kssos.org/srvimages/cfr_images/B09244AAAKW.tiff">scanned tiff files</a> aren't "open government." They're a good faith step in the right direction, but they hide the potential that raw data provides. How can I feed that information into a program to analyze it and look for patterns?</p>

<p>I hope the state doesn't squander this opportunity. There's an opportunity to appoint someone who gets open government and who would make it their mission to open the floodgates on the information that the SoS office controls. Once you provide citizens (and journalists) with the raw numbers about campaigns, where money's being spent, where money's coming from, you open yourself up to all sorts of interesting interpretations. You start moving from that "available" column toward the "accessible" column. That's what the open government movement is all about afterall.</p>

        <title>Are we our brother's keeper?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's 37&deg; F (2.7&deg; C) and dropping.  It's going to hover near freezing tonight, and come midnight... flip a coin - head's it rains, tails it's dry.  And he's out there.</p>

<p>I know he's not my responsibility.  But isn't he?</p>

<p>There's a big guy that's homeless here in Lawrence.  You know him if you've lived in or around downtown Lawrence.  The guy's <em>really</em> big.  He started hanging around South Park shortly after the Salvation Army closed their shelter.  We noticed him hanging out early in the morning and in the evenings.  It wasn't long before we put two and two together.  He'd taken up residence.  At least over night.</p>

<p>As the temperature started dropping, he and the other few souls that would spend the night in South Park on the benches, in the gazebo, or under the stairs at the gazebo started disappearing.  I assumed they'd found shelter somewhere warm, or moved south following the warmer temperatures.  Tonight, as it warms up to a balmy 37, he was back.</p>

<p>We noticed him earlier this evening as we walked the dogs.  Meg pointed him out as we started in to South Park.  He was headed down the red-bud path.  As he got closer, we could see the two pieces of cardboard he was carrying.  My heart went out to him as I realized what he had done.  He'd scavenged up some insulation for the night to come.</p>

<p>Continuing on our walk, he milled around South Park some more.  As we finished our loop through the park with our dogs, I saw him lumbering off back toward downtown.  "Well, maybe he isn't spending the night in the park," I reassured myself and didn't give it another thought.  Meg and carried on our evening, including some pizza and beer at the Oread and a Jayhawks game.</p>

<p>Walking back down the mountain tonight, I couldn't help but scan the park.  The benches were all empty, as was the gazebo.  Maybe he had found a spot in <a href="http://www.lawrenceshelter.org/">the shelter</a>.  Then I saw under the stairs.  His unmistakable girth, under a pile of blankets, huddled up against the gazebo.</p>

<p>I quietly motioned to Meg.  Our banter, lively all the way home, died.</p>

<p>After we had passed the gazebo I said, "I <em>know</em> he's not my responsibility.  But if he isn't mine, who's is he?"</p>

<p>I don't know what I could have done.  I don't know his story.  Could I approach him, or is he unstable?  Why's he homeless?  Is it a "lifestyle choice", as <a href="http://downtownlawrence.com/">certain organizations</a> would have you believe of the majority of Lawrence's homeless, or is he one of those guys who just had one too many blows and hasn't been able to get back up?</p>

<p>I wonder though, what is my responsibility?  What is our responsibility?  If you believe in a higher power, when he comes asking "where's the big guy?", are you going to respond "am I my brother's keeper?", or will you response "I am my brother's keeper, he's over here"?</p>

        <title>Packaging reuseabe &amp; testable Django apps with virtualenv, pip, and Fabric</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2010/01/17/django-virtualenv-pip-and-fabric/"/>
        <updated>2010-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2010/01/17/django-virtualenv-pip-and-fabric</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone noted the other day on one of my Facebook posts, I've been doing a
lot of Python development.  I've moved almost entirely to Python for
development, web and otherwise.  Instead of PHP, I reach for Django when I need
to prototype an application quickly.</p>
<p>One of the things I've been struggling with is how to build re-usable
applications that are testable without having the entire Django stack running.
Until recently, I've used <a href="http://www.buildout.org/">buildout</a> to handle this.  There's a
<a href="https://launchpad.net/djangorecipe">djangorecipe</a> for creating a Django repository.  I include that, a sample
project, the necessary requirements in a <code>buildout.cfg</code> and away we go.</p>
<p>All was well, until I included two project that had a sample <code>project/</code>
directory.  The base Django project couldn't figure out what was what, problems
abound.  There are other solutions.  I could have set the <code>project</code> (doesn't
this seem like the Misses Bennett in Pride and Prejudice?) variable to change
it on a per-app basis, but that still left me with some problems.</p>
<p>Namely, I don't like the default layout of djangorecipe's Django project.  I
wanted to change it, but after some digging around in buildout's internals, I
realized it wasn't going to be a solution I could live with long term.  I'd
heard a lot of people (by that, I mean <a href="http://www.b-list.org/">James</a>) state their preference for
<a href="http://virtualenv.openplans.org/">virtualenv</a> and <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/">pip</a>.  The separation of concerns (one application for
isolation, another for installation) instead of the all-in-one approach of
buildout felt better to me, so I started exploring.</p>
<p>And I came up empty.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about using virutalenv and pip together; pip
<a href="http://pip.openplans.org/#using-pip-with-virtualenv">documents how</a> to install into a virtual environment; but no one talks about
how to use everything together with Django.  Specifically, no one mentions what
to include in your repository.  Until now. :-)</p>
<h3>Setting up the repository</h3>
<p>The most important part of this for me was what to store in the repository.
It's simple enough, really.  First, you need a <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/#requirements-files">requirements.txt</a> file.  For
most simple Django apps, it contains one line.  For example, this is what
the <a href="http://github.com/domain51/d51.django.apps.tagging/blob/master/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> file for
<a href="http://github.com/domain51/d51.django.apps.tagging/">d51.django.apps.tagging</a> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>Django
</code></pre>
<p>The next thing I need is a simple <code>.gitignore</code> file.  My mantra is to not
commit anything that I can generate.  This means all of the files generated by
virtualenv and pip need to be ignored.  I also ignore the swap files created by
Vim (hey, I'm not the only one at the company who uses it, so might as well
ignore it) and I ignore all <code>.pyc</code> and <code>.pyo</code> files.  The resulting
<a href="http://github.com/domain51/d51.django.apps.tagging/blob/master/.gitignore">.gitignore</a> file looks like:</p>
<pre><code>bin/*
include/*
lib/*
.*.swp
*.py[co]
</code></pre>
<p>Now we're ready.  Of course, you need to have virtualenv and pip installed, but
once you've done that, running tests are pretty simple.  First, you have to
initialize the environment:</p>
<pre><code>prompt&gt; git clone git://github.com/domain51/d51.django.apps.tagging.git
prompt&gt; cd d51.django.apps.tagging
prompt&gt; virtualenv .
prompt&gt; pip install -E . -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The observant might notice my call to virtualenv.  I've left out the parameter
<code>--no-site-packages</code>.  Two reasons.  First, I don't keep things like Django
installed at the <code>site-packages</code> level.  Second, the things I do install, tools
like Fabric, I want access to them while in the virtual environment without
having to re-install them.</p>
<p>Now that the virtualenv has been initialized, now you need to activate the
virtual environment:</p>
<pre><code>prompt&gt; source ./bin/activate
(d51.django.apps.tagging)prompt&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the prompt changes.  It's prefixed with the name of the directory
you're in to signify that you're inside virtualenv.  Now running the tests
are dead simple:</p>
<pre><code>(d51.django.apps.tagging)prompt&gt; python ./run_tests.py
</code></pre>
<h3>Testing Django apps inside virtualenv</h3>
<p>I need audio that plays when you get to this line.  That screeching record
player coming to halt.  The visual question mark.  What's this <code>./run_tests.py</code>
file you ask?  The secret sauce.</p>
<p>Django wants to be setup in order to run.  Normally that's requires a project,
<code>settings.py</code>, and a partridge in a pear tree.  Unless you call
<code>settings.configure</code>.  You can use that to mimic the normal Django settings,
tweaking the settings to match your needs for testing.</p>
<p>For d51.django.apps.tagging, the settings are pretty simple.  I need to make
sure that my app is available along with <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/ref/contrib/contenttypes/">django.contrib.contenttypes</a> since
I make use of the generic relationship code.  There's also some cargo culting
required, as Django won't run without a <code>DATABASE_ENGINE</code> specified.  The end
result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import call_command

def main():
    # Dynamically configure the Django settings with the minimum necessary to
    # get Django running tests
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'd51.django.apps.tagging',
        ),
        # Django replaces this, but it still wants it. *shrugs*
        DATABASE_ENGINE='sqlite3'
    )

    # Fire off the tests
    call_command('test', 'tagging')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<h3>Running without activating virtualenv</h3>
<p>This works, but requires that you always have virtualenv activated.  For
example, if you deactivate virtualenv and try to run the test, you get
an <code>ImportError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(d51.django.apps.tagging)prompt&gt; deactivate
prompt&gt; python run_tests.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "run_tests.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from django.conf import settings
ImportError: No module named django.conf
</code></pre>
<p>You can programmatically activate virtualenv, however, by including this
snippet of code in a .py file located in the root of your repository:</p>
<pre><code>execfile('./bin/activate_this.py',
         dict(__file__='./bin/activate_this.py'))
</code></pre>
<p>You can add that line to the top of the file and execute <code>run_tests.py</code> without
needing to activate the virtualenv before hand.  The line needs to go before
the <code>from django.conf</code> line to make sure that Python knows where to find Django
and any other requirements of the test.</p>
<p>This requires that you activate the virtual environment prior to running the
test, or have Django installed at the system level.  This can be further
simplified and remove the need to activate and deactivate the environment prior
to test runs by executing the <code>bin/activate_this.py</code> file that virtualenv ships
with.</p>
<h3>Making this reusable</h3>
<p>There's a lot of code in that <code>run_tests.py</code> file that is going to be
duplicated for every project.  Actually, there's only three lines, well, two
lines and one variable in a line, in it that are unique: the two line of
<code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> and the app name to test in the <code>call_command</code> line.</p>
<p>To keep from repeating that for every single project, I created a simple
harness for initializing tests.  Introducing
<a href="http://github.com/domain51/d51.django.virtualenv.test_runner">d51.django.virtualenv.test_runner</a>, a very small package for running Django
tests inside virtualenv.</p>
<p>Using this, <code>run_tests.py</code> now looks like:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    from d51.django.virtualenv.test_runner import run_tests
except ImportError:
    print "Please install d51.django.virtualenv.test_runner to run these tests"

def main():
    settings = {
        "INSTALLED_APPS": (
            "django.contrib.contenttypes",
            "d51.django.apps.tagging",
        ),
    }
    run_tests(settings, 'tagging')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>The first four lines give the user some input when they run the tests without
test harness.  That's optional, depending on how user friendly you want to be.
After that, all I do is call <code>run_tests</code> with a <code>settings</code> dictionary and the
name of the app I want to test.</p>
<p>There is one downside, though.  You have have it installed outside of your
virtualenv in order to run your tests.  Personally, I'm not to worried about it,
as I have it installed, but if you're really paranoid, you could include it in
your <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which would require that the user be inside the
virtualenv to run your tests.</p>
<h3>Wrapping it all up in a Fabric cloth</h3>
<p>The final step is to make all of this bullet proof is creating a Fabric file
that handles all of the initialization and running of the tests for me.  For
good measure, it should also be capable of cleaning up after itself.  I don't
need a bazillion copies of Django laying around, afterall.</p>
<p>The end result looks something like this (using Fabric 1.0a):</p>
<pre><code>from fabric.api import local

def test():
    """
    Run tests for d51.django.apps.schedules
    """
    local("python ./run_tests.py")

def init():
    """
    Initialize a virtualenv in which to run tests against this
    """
    local("virtualenv .")
    local("pip install -E . -r requirements.txt")

def clean():
    """
    Remove the cruft created by virtualenv and pip
    """
    local("rm -rf bin/ include/ lib/")
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run the initialize the environment, run the tests, and clean up
after yourself with three commands:</p>
<pre><code>prompt&gt; fab init
prompt&gt; fab test
prompt&gt; fab clean
</code></pre>
<p>One drawback to this method, Fabric's <code>local</code> command swallows the output
of the test.  This isn't a problem until you have a failure.  <code>local</code> does
contain a <code>capture</code> parameter, but it doesn't display the output from an
failed command.  That's fixable, but for the time being, my recommendation
is to use Fabric as your quick sanity check, but rely on straight
<code>python ./run_tests.py</code> for your real testing.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That brings us to the end of our quick tour.  Hopefully this provides you with
the information you need to get started using virtualenv and pip with Django.
It's not that complicated.  Actually, once you have your bearings, it's
downright easy.  The problem is more that people who have trodden down this
path haven't documented their way.  Hopefully, this post helps serve as a rough
map.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>I'd like to thanks <a href="http://www.b-list.org/">James Bennett</a> for illuminating a few pieces of this
puzzle for me (in particular, pointing me toward <code>settings.configure</code>) and his
preview a draft of the article before I posted.  I'd also like to thank 
<a href="http://jefftriplett.com/">Jeff Triplett</a> for his comments on a draft and pointing out an unexplained
inconsistency with the rest of the world's examples of virtualenv.  And, as
always, my good buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/roder">Roder</a> for his constant encouragement.</p>

        <title>The problem with Python namespaces modules (or, Python Namespaces.  There be dragons this way.)</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/12/22/the-problem-with-python-namespaces-modul/"/>
        <updated>2009-12-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/12/22/the-problem-with-python-namespaces-modul</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/status/6897861818">lamented the issues with namespaces</a> in Python. It's not really the namespaces, it's the marketing of namespaces. Newbies to the community (something I still consider myself for most purposes) are drawn to modules thinking that there's a one-to-one relationship between file hierarchy and namespaces. And there is. Well, sort of.</p>

<p>You have to read the entire manual or happen to have someone to point out the difference between namespaces and modules to even realize there is a difference. Under most circumstances, you won't even realize they are different until you start to do something slightly complex. Say, for example, building an application with multiple modules inside a similar namespace, each module in a separate repository and its own history. There needs to be a "there be dragons" warning to let people know.</p>

<p>Those dragons are such: you have two paths inside <code>sys.path</code> that contain similar code. Such as I do with all of the <a href="http://github.com/domain51">Domain51</a> code. Package one has <code>foo</code> as a module while package two contains <code>bar</code>. The assumption would be that Python acts like most other languages and would exhaust it's <code>sys.path</code> trying to find both packages, but that's not the case. It'll get to the first one, then pretend the second doesn't exist.</p>

<p>The fix for this is the explicitness, one of Python's cardinal virtues. You <em>have to declare</em> the namespace in order for it to work. As you don't see this hardly anywhere in Python because Pythonistas feel that namespaces are a bad idea, here's the code you need to include in your __init__.py file to make it declare itself as a namespace:</p>

<pre><code>
import pkg_resources
pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>That's it. Now Python becomes smart again, and you can have real namespaces with similar directory structures existing side-by-side. Python is perfectly capable of finding them - now. Which raises an interesting question: why does Python scan the entire sys.path looking for files, building up this list of what declares what namespaces and where only to ignore it later unless they're explicit about it? I haven't dove into the source to be sure, but it seems it would have to scan the <code>__init__.py</code> files in order to know whether there's something there.</p>

<p>But I digress. There's a bigger dragon that's not even hinted at. Python's inability to find modules.</p>

<p>Take, for example, my <a href="http://github.com/tswicegood/python-stupidity">python-stupidity</a> repository on GitHub. Run the <code>test.py</code> file and you can see the error for yourself. There are two <code>barfoo</code> modules within the path, but Python decides to act the villagedolt and stop as soon as it hits the first one that might match. This particular case is caused by <code>foobar</code> trying to import a method from <code>barfoo</code> that doesn't exist in <code>foobar.barfoo</code></p>

<p>This is, in my opinion, a <em>huge</em> issue. Note that <code>foobar.barfoo</code> declared it's namespace. It said loudly, "I am me", and Python ignored that fact in favor of relative includes. Not only that, but it stopped and started pouting as soon as one module that said it was <code>foobar.barfoo</code> couldn't match.</p>

<p>Why not finishing looking through the rest of the <code>sys.path</code>? Why not pay attention to that precious declaration Python wants you to add to explicitly become a namespace?</p>

<p>Like almost all problems with programming languages, however, there is a fix. At first glance, I thought it might be the way PHP handled it - just include a separator at the beginning of the import. That didn't work, but in searching for the solution, I found out that Python supports relative imports through it's support of <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references">intra package references</a>. The fix within the <code>foobar</code> module is to do <code>from ..barfoo import base_barfoo</code>, but this only covers you if you're in Python 2.5 or later.</p>

<p>According to my understanding of it, you use it to explicitly say I want a sibling module names X without having to declare the entire namespace or accidentally picking up a module from the global namespace. Fair enough, but my solution to the problem above is to use the relative import to trick Python into thinking it couldn't find a module named the same.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://github.com/domain51/d51.django.auth/blob/master/d51/django/auth/decorators.py#L3">see the code</a> in the <a href="http://github.com/domain51/d51.django.auth/">d51.django.auth</a> package. I have a <code>d51.django.auth.facebook</code> module which takes precedent over <a href="http://github.com/sciyoshi/pyfacebook/">PyFacebook's</a> <code>facebook</code> module, but only inside the <code>d51.django.auth</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that namespaces are a bad idea in Python or any other language. I'll gladly take namespaces, in <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rationale.php">any form I can get them</a> and <a href="http://github.com/tswicegood/argil">use them</a>. They provide a great way to segregate code into small, independent, re-usable packages while continuing to say "I'm from over here." They allow <code>facebook</code> to be used as a module in multiple places without causing an issue, other than the ones listed here.</p>

<p>No, my problem is not with namespaces. My problem is with Python's current method for searching for them; it's lack of exposing namespaces and modules and their differences up front, and it's brain dead way of halting on the first partial hit. I'm amazed that <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">a language that prides itself on explicitness</a>&mdash;on not doing anything that's not asked for&mdash;decides that it's ok to stop looking for matching code just because it found one thing that doesn't match. It smacks of premature optimization.</p>

        <title>Books I don't recommend if you're starting out</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/12/01/books-i-don-t-recommend-if-you-re-starti/"/>
        <updated>2009-12-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/12/01/books-i-don-t-recommend-if-you-re-starti</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Keith Casey's <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog/my-book-recommendations">recent post</a> on a book recommendations got me thinking.  I get asked what books I recommend.  I whole-heartedly agree with his first recommendation.  The <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a> sits on my desk and is often in my laptop bag.  I reach for it if I have five minutes and want to flip through something technical without having to load up my Google Reader.</p>

<p>Not on his list is the <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Passionate Programmer</a>.  I <em>highly</em> recommend this book to anyone working in the industry.  I've <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H34FVR9Y8SIJ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">reviewed it on Amazon</a>, feel free to check that out for more information.</p>

<p>But this post isn't about what I recommend, it's what I don't.  There are two books that Keith recommends that I no longer recommend off the bat to programmers.  <abbr title="Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture">PEAA</abbr> and Refactoring.  Both are excellent books, but neither should be read by people starting out.</p>

<p>Why?  The books are both excellent.  I've read both.  I own both.  I do recommend them, some of the time.  Both are geared toward programmers that already know how to program.  Both contain a wealth of information which, in the right hands, can take the development of the reader to the next level.</p>

<p>But they also contain information that can be abused tremendously.  For example, Active Record in it's abused, single-world form of ActiveRecord has caused a tremendous about of scaling issues.  All because it was a Fowler endorsed method for dealing with data in a database.  Developers without an understanding of its limitations started copying what Rails did and in the process mixed business logic and database logic into the same object.  What happens when your data needs to be stored in a flat file or a nosql style database?  Your business logic is now all tied up in your database and its painful to extract that and retrofit your application to be scalable.</p>

<p>Of course, since you have Refactoring you can fix that.  Right?  Well, sort of.  Patterns and refactoring go hand in hand.  Ideally, refactoring code should lead to some more understandable, reusable code; something that's more easily explained to another developer.  Patterns fill the bill.  Nowhere in Refactoring or Joshua Kerievsky's Refactoring to Patterns will you find anything about pattern hoping.  To fix an improper use of ActiveRecord by moving to another pattern, however, you end up doing exactly that.</p>

<p>Couple that with the sweater string issue.  We've all had a loose string on a sweater, right?  You give it a tug instinctively to get rid of it, and before you know it a hem in gone and the sweater is ruined.  Refactoring, in the wrong hands, causes the same thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, I need to extract this logic out.  Next this piece needs to be mutable.  I should inject this object so I can replace it out later if I need to.  And so on, and so on, ad infinitum.</p></blockquote>

<p>Both patterns and refactoring are powerful tools, but not in the hands of a novice.  Both books should be read, but not when you're starting out.  Get your hands on Pragmatic and Passionate, spend some time looking for a mentor to help guide you down the right path.  Once you get your feet under you as a programmer, then start learning about the mechanics of patterns and refactoring.  Once you're to that point, PEAA and Refactoring are great material.</p>

        <title>Recap of ZendCon 09</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/29/recap-of-zendcon-09/"/>
        <updated>2009-10-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/29/recap-of-zendcon-09</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Wow!  Has it already been nearly a week since <a href="http://zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a> wrapped up?!  Time is flying right now,
and with <a href="http://it-republik.de/php/phpconference09/"><abbr title="International PHP Conference">IPC</abbr></a> and the holidays right
around the corner, I don't see it getting any less hectic.
</p>
<p>
ZendCon was fun.  This was my first time attending/presenting this particular
conference.  It had a distinctly different feel too it than the conferences put
on by <a href="http://blog.tabini.ca/">Marco</a> and company.  ZC felt more
corporate than tek does, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  We tend to
forget that if it weren't for the business interests at play none of us would
have jobs.
</p>
<p>

I made it to only a handful of talks, but everything I attended was top-notch.
I'd highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com/">Josh
Holmes'</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joshholmes/the-lost-art-of-simplicity">The Lost
Art of Simplicity</a> talk.  He presented it in the uncon, but accept it as a
keynote if he submits it to your conference.
</p>
<p>

Speaking of Microsoft (Josh works for them) they stepped up in a huge way
Wednesday night.  The topic of what to do after the Ask Zend session that night
and the idea of heading up to San Francisco came up.  Josh jumped into gear and
not only got us into the Bing party that was going on in conjunction with Web
2.0, but also scored us all copies of Windows 7 and a party bus to get us there
and back!
</p>
<p>

Microsoft catches a lot of crap from the open-source community, some of it
warranted, but they're heading in the right direction as long as they keep
hiring guys like Josh and making them the face of Microsoft.  The company will
have no choice to change if it's made up guys who are really taking the <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/2006/10/30/the-blue-monster/">blue monster</a> to
heart.
</p>
<p>

The cynic in me has to ask if this isn't just a long-view version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">embrace,
extend, and extinguish</a> via slowly causing liver failure in the main
contributors to open source! :-D
</p>
<p>

I also finally got a <a href="http://rubyrags.com/products/10">Fork You</a>
shirt from the guys over at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  I'm
thinking of forking the shirt design and updating it to say:
</p>

<blockquote>Fork Me</blockquote>

<p>
On the Git front, I might have made <a href="http://elizabethmariesmith.com/">Elizabeth M. Smith</a> mad enough at
the state of the current Git Windows tools to actually do something about it.
She started hacking a bit on it at the conference, and I'm sure we'll see
something by the end of the year (right, Liz?).
</p>

<p>
Next up for me (and my final conference of 2009) is the <a href="http://it-republik.de/php/phpconference09/"> International PHP
Conference</a> in Germany.  I'll be giving a talk titled Building Real-Time
Applications using XMPP.  Meg is tagging along and we're going to see some of
southern Germany after the conference.  Definitely looking forward to the time
off on another continent.

        <title>Lawrence Programmers Hack Nights</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/18/lawrence-programmers-hack-nights/"/>
        <updated>2009-10-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/18/lawrence-programmers-hack-nights</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I've been kicking around the idea of starting a hacking night/weekend type thing.  I think it'd be a blast to take one evening or afternoon a month or maybe even ever week, commit to a particular project and get a bunch of people in the same room and hack on it.  We do a lot of yacking at LPDN, this would be an opportunity to do a lot of coding.  Ya know, less bitching, more fixing.</p>

<p>There's a couple of possible formats.  I'm curious to get some feedback.  What do you think would be more fun?</p>

<ul><li>First, we pitch around a few ideas over at <a href="http://lawrence.ning.com/group/programmers">Lawrence Programmers</a>, come up with some new library or software, hack it together, release it, and all feel good about contributing to the world at large.</li>
<li>Second, we could pick open source projects and contribute to them.  PHP has had some big successes with their <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">Test Fests</a>.  There's plenty of open source projects in every language that would love more unit tests or some bug squashing.  We could trade languages, each month doing something different with people that know that language taking the lead.  Get someone from each language to chaperon their own language.</li>
<li>Third, we could do something <a href="http://givecamp.org/">GiveCamp</a> style.  Get people to donate a weekend and hack out as much as we can for non-profits.  There's plenty of non-profits that could use a hand.  I know of one (*wink* *wink*) that has a ton of really cool projects, including a few big ones, that they need done and hacking together something to get it kick started would be awesome.</li>
<li>Or finally, we could create an evening every week where people bring their laptops, <a href="http://github.com/toolmantim/bananajour">Bananajour</a> prepared, and hack on whatever they're up to.</li></ul>

<p>Having a hacking night sounds kind of fun to me.  The big projects definitely have a lot of potential for great things coming out of them and I plan on getting a Kansas Give Camp organized sometime this winter, but based on the experience I had getting <a href="http://lawrence.ning.com/group/programmers">Lawrence Programmers</a> off the ground, I think we're probably better off to start slow, maybe declaring one night a week hack night at a coffee shop or some such.</p>

        <title>John Deere and iPhones</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/18/john-deere-and-iphones/"/>
        <updated>2009-10-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/18/john-deere-and-iphones</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Twitter the other day, <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/status/4930889727">I said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I might be the first person in history to use John Deer and the iPhone together in the same sentence to illustrate a point.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I know, there's a typo there; but I fixed it in the title, that counts for something, right?  Anyhow, I thought it would do to explain what I meant.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2009/10/how-you-know-phone-is-rubbish.html">How you know a phone is rubbish</a> the other day talking about the difference between iPhone ads and everything else.  The gist: iPhone ads show you an iPhone, Pre, Blackberry, etc., etc., etc., ad infinitum, show you what your life will be like if you purchase their phone.</p>

<p>My favorite has to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hk8IzdwYEA">this Pre commercial</a> (which for some reason doesn't want to embed correctly).  It seems to suggest that all you need to do is purchase a Pre and the world starts bowing down before you in perfect harmony.  If only.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johndeere.com/">John Deere</a> commercials tend toward the same path as an iPhone.  Granted, I seem to recall (can't verify as John Deere doesn't seem to post their commercials anywhere online) a few commercials that show husbands getting that little bit of extra adoration from their wives after mowing the lawn and such, but generally John Deere commercials focus on John Deere tractors and the satisfaction you get using them.</p>

<p>I think its fair to say that both John Deere (yes, yes, I know.  I'm showing my midwest colors right about now) and the iPhone are iconic symbols.  Both are instantly recognizable, and both have rabid followers.  To top it off, both rely on images of using their product in their marketing, not trailers for faux-movies or promises of a more balanced life perched upon a rock, to convince you that you should be using their products.</p>

<p>That's going to be the goal for any software products that I create from here on out.  No gimmicks to give you a subminial message that the package is superior.  Instead, it's going to be all about the package.  Use this software because it's good at what it does and you need what it does.</p>

        <title>My Productivity Hack: 4 hour work day and GTD</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/10/my-productivity-hack-4-hour-work-day-and/"/>
        <updated>2009-10-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/10/10/my-productivity-hack-4-hour-work-day-and</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Productivity has been one of my biggest challenges.  Well, let me rephrase.  <em>Consistently</em> producing extremely productive days has been one of my biggest challenges.  I'm an overachiever and since that came naturally, I've never had to be scientific about getting things done.  Until lately, at least.</p>

<div><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/gtd.jpg" alt="Getting Things Done" /><p>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rintakumpu/2290399699/">rintakumpu</a></p></div>

<p>The last few years, I've noticed its become harder and harder stay on track.  Twitter, IRC, Digg, Email, IM, Facebook, etc., etc., ad infinitum, are always competing for my attention, and when they're all a keystroke away, it becomes too easy to check it "just this once"... again.</p>

<p>They say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program#Twelve_Steps">realization is the first step</a> to fixing the problem.  I've been working on that lately.  Between launching <a href="http://water.org">multiple</a> <a href="http://challenge.water.org/">websites</a>, <a href="http://codeworks.mtacon.com/">speaking</a> <a href="http://zendcon.com/">at multiple</a> <a href="http://it-republik.de/php/phpconference/">conferences</a> this fall, and launching a new company... well, let's just say my time is at a premium.  Figuring out how to use my time efficiently has been forced to the top of my priorities.</p>

<p>One tool I've started using is <a href="http://culturedcode.com/">Cultured Code's</a> <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>.  I switched from <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> because Things focuses on being simple.  Dead simple.  Yes, I know you use the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD">GTD</a> workflow in OmniFocus, but I'm a categorizer.  I have over 1,000 tags in <a href="http://delicious.com/tags/tswicegood?view=all&amp;">my delicious</a>.  That's just bookmarks!</p>

<p>Another thing I'm getting ready to start this next week is something I pulled out of <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/">Scott H Young's</a> <a href="http://thinksimplenow.com/productivity/the-4-hour-workday/"4 hour workday</a> post.  He says to setup your tasks in weekly and daily goals.  Each day, pick the things from your weekly list that have to get completed, then do them.  You don't stop working until those are done, but when they are, you stop regardless of whether it is 10 AM, or 10 PM.</p>

<p>This suites itself well to the categorization schema of GTD and Things.  I just started by clearing everything out of my Next bucket in Things and putting them all in Someday bucket.  Then, I triaged that list 58 items and pull the 16 that need to happen this next week.  I'm sure that list is going to grow, but this gives me a start.  Each day this week, I'm going to start the day by pulling tasks out of the Next list, and those are the things that have to get accomplished that day.  Once I'm through it, I'll switch gears onto other projects.</p>

<p>I think I might be onto something here.  I haven't seen this style of GTD before.  That said, I haven't really spent a lot of time looking around.  I know one of my big problems the past few weeks using Things is that I tend to just keep adding tasks into Today.  I have a dozen things marked off as completed for the day, but most of them were added right before I switched gears into it.  This should help keep me in check.</p>

Got any ideas on how you use GTD?  Does something else work for you?  I'd love to hear some feedback, so I can see how to hack this to make it better.</a>

<p>Started to respond on Facebook, but ran into their limit, so I'm responding on my blog...</p>

<p>Went to take my boarding pass that he was handing to me, then snapped that back at me.  Let me back up with the context.</p>

<p>I was standing in line at the curbside checkin with everyone else from CodeWorks '09.  The guy who's line I'm standing in takes a bag back to the conveyor, then disappears through another door.  I'm standing around looking dumbfounded while the other two guys are continuing to check people that came in after us.</p>

<p>Finally, I asked him if we lost the other guy or not?  "I don't know" then after he finishes with another person who just walked up he proclaims "next".  I walk over, start the process, everything's fine.</p>

<p>Then he calls me down to get my boarding pass and baggage check ticket.  He starts handing it to me (I thought) and is pointing out what's what.  I go to take it from him and he jerks it back and says "I see why the other guy left!"  Then mumbles something about this being for express check-in and next time I shouldn't park illegally and tie it up for people who know what they're doing.  He was old and not particularly articulate, so that combined with being floored by the lecture I didn't catch exactly what he said.</p>

<p>I rarely fly American anyhow, but you can bet I won't be flying on them again where I pay for the flight.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has been taken over this morning by #wtc, #sept11, and a host of other related hash tags.  Everyone, understandably, wants to share where they were and what they were doing when America's outlook changed forever.  Even "God Bless America" has made it onto the trending topics of the day.</p>

<p>We all know the numbers.  3,017 dead, over 6,000 physically injured and many millions more left with scares of a different type, but let's look at some other numbers.</p>

<ul><li>1 injured</li>
<li>1 dead, 1 injured</li>
<li>3 dead, 3 injured</li>
<li>101 dead, 536 injured</li></ul>

<p>That's the numbers from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents,_2009">terrorist attacks around the world</a> in the last 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Terrorism isn't going away easily.  We can't "God Bless" ourselves out of it.  Instead of just remembering where you were that morning, think about what you've done these past 8 years to help create a world where terrorism isn't a normal part of life.  Figure out what you can do to make tomorrow better than today, then <em>do</em> it.</p>

        <title>My introduction to Timeless Way of Building</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/08/10/my-introduction-to-timeless-way-of-build/"/>
        <updated>2009-08-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/08/10/my-introduction-to-timeless-way-of-build</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To bring my blog readers up to speed.  I posted this status update earlier in the evening:</p>

<blockquote><p>Random question: How have I made it this far and not read The Timeless Way of Building yet?</p></blockquote>

<p>I got this response from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/billkarwin">Bill Karwin</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I just heard about Christopher Alexander within the last year too. Dunno why I had not heard about him previously, given how much he influenced the OO paradigm. How did you come across him, and what has resonated with you most?</p></blockquote>

<p>I started to respond, but then Facebook cut me off.  They seem to limit the length of comments (once again, for convenience we're giving up control...  I seriously think 1,000 characters is barely enough to get started in), but since I control the spigot here and can be as long-winded as I like, I'll post my comment here.  Without further adieu...</p>

<p>I've heard of him a lot because of his Pattern Language book, but I'd never heard of this one. Reading the <a href="http://slash7.com/articles/2009/8/10/screw-interface-patterns">Screw Interface Patterns</a> article on slash7 today got me thinking about it again and I determined to check it out the next time I had a few free minutes.</p>

<p>After dinner tonight, I stopped by the bookstore to check out A Pattern Language.  The introduction talks about the Timeless Way of Building as the metabook (my words) of Pattern Language and how they really aren't separable: one provides the context, the other provides the words.   Timeless Way was on the shelf next to it, so I picked it up and read the introduction.  I was mesmerized. People don't write that eloquently, myself not excluded, any longer.</p>

<p>There was a powerful quote in the first chapter, and one that I find ironic giving the state of design patterns and refactoring in programming.</p>

<blockquote><p>But though this method [of defining architecture through patterns] is precise, it cannot be used mechanically.  <em>Page 12</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't help but think of all of the tools that enable refactoring. How we've tried to reduce patterns into reproducible macros and missed the spirit. It's too bad, really. I think a proper understanding of design patterns, be they of the structure of the code or the interface to it, can lead to <em>much</em> better code.</p>

<p>I ordered a copy tonight (couldn't pass up the $25 savings by having Amazon ship it) and plan on devouring it.  I'm sure there'll be plenty of notes on my <a href="http://readernaut.com/tswicegood/books/0195024028/the-timeless-way-of-building/">Readernaut</a> page as I work through it.</p>

        <title>Making the Hang: My Story</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/08/07/making-the-hang-my-story/"/>
        <updated>2009-08-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/08/07/making-the-hang-my-story</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler's</a> <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer/">Passionate Programmer</a> book.  It quickly earned a spot as one of my favorite books on the topic of programming and careers.  I highly recommend it, and have been tweaking a book review that I'll post up soon, but I wanted to talk about want chapter that stuck out at me.  Making the Hang.</p>

<p>The chapter talks about one of Chad's high school jazz buddies, Chris.  Chris was a good musician, but he made sure he hung around with all of the guys who were better than he was and would pepper them with questions every chance he got.  He called it making the hang.  For some reason, this stuck out at me.  I couldn't put my finger on it for a few days, and then it hit me.  I've been doing this for a long time.</p>

<p>The first hang I made wasn't in the music scene or the technology scene, it was cycling.  In particular, competitive mountain bike racing. A few years back I started riding more and more, wound up a regular at the weekly group rides, and finally decided to try my luck at racing.  To this day there are few things I enjoy as much as that adrenaline rush you get as you pull up the line at the start of a race. </p>

<p>Starting out, I asked questions of anyone who would humor me.  Looking back on it, I can see how Chad thought Chris might be annoying the musicians and I'm surprised I didn't annoy more people with my constant questions about racing.  How do you prepare?  What's your training like?  Do you really think two-a-days work?  What about road cycling?  Is there any crossover benefit for mountain biking?  Maybe we can go for a ride some time?</p>

<p>I was like a walking 20 questions game.  But it worked.  I not only finished the first race I ever entered, a 100 kilometer race in Juarez, Mexico, I surpassed my goal by over 50 places (was shooting for a top 250 out of more than 1,000 that would finish, and got inside the top 200).  I know it's because I was prepared for the race.  I'd asked enough questions of enough different people that I knew what to expect.  I didn't have to learn the hard way, all I had to do was get my skill up to par.</p>

<p>I kept it up, and the next year I was 46 in a field that was won by the sitting Mexican national champion including winning a personal race within the race, I beat one of the guys who I'd been asking questions of the whole past year at the final sprint.  I still had legs after 62 miles of racing to sprint for the line and he couldn't contest it.</p>

<p>It's happened in other parts of my life.  When I took up road cycling, I literally learned to make the hang.  The first group road ride I ever went on involved me with a group for about 30 minutes of a 90 minute ride followed by a long, solo trip back after I got dropped.  By the end of that summer I was hanging with the group the entire ride and even making challenges at some of the sprints along the route.</p>

<p>When I got serious about moving from a hacker to a programmer, I made the hang by joining an open source project.  <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/">Marcus Baker</a> always had more time than I could expect to answer silly questions and help shape my view on what a programmer ought to do.  I'm a TDD guy today explicitly because of those interactions with him.</p>

<p>So what's the moral of this story?  I guess "get out there!"  Talk to people.  Hone those people skills and above all, don't be afraid to be annoying.  9 times out of 10, the person you're "annoying" (in your mind at least) is going to be so flattered that you respect their opinion that they'll spend hours talking to you and answering every last question you have.  Don't believe me?  Try it some time and tell me if you didn't get anything out it.</p>

        <title>Compiling Node.js on Ubuntu 9.04</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/07/11/compiling-node-js-on-ubuntu-9-04/"/>
        <updated>2009-07-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/07/11/compiling-node-js-on-ubuntu-9-04</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Someone pointed me to <a href="http://tinyclouds.org/node/">Node.js</a> a month or so again.  It's a web server that you interact with entirely in Javascript.  It uses Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> engine and makes claims of being fast.  I've wanted to play with it on a real server for awhile.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had an evening to play, so I spun up a few <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">cloud servers</a>, one to drive the test and another to actually run Node on.  I had compiled Node on my Macbook Pro the same day I saw it, it literally was a matter of three commands and I was up.  I didn't anticipate running into any issues, boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>For those of you who are inpatient, here's the quick and dirty version of getting Node compiled.</p>

<p>    sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev-i386 lib32stdc++6 git-core &amp;&amp;<br />
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so &amp;&amp;<br />
    git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git &amp;&amp;<br />
    cd node &amp;&amp;<br />
    ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</p>

<p>That's out of the way, now I'm going to draw you into the whole saga.  Why?  Because I spent several hours trying to figure this out on my own and while having conversations with guys a lot smarter than I am.  Google turned up no help, so I figure writing a nice, long post with all of the errors you're going to get might prove a nice little Google honey pot and help someone out in the future when they go to try and figure this out.</p>

<p>First up, Node requires that you build from source.  Since my Mosso box was starting from scratch, I needed to get the <code>build-essential</code> package installed along with <code>git-core</code> since I was planning on installing the latest development version from <a href="http://github.com/ry/node">Node's GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core</code></pre>

<p>Once that was installed, time to clone the repository and get started building.</p>


<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
... output from clone ...
$ cd node
$ ./configure
... output from configure ...
$ make
Waf: Entering directory `/home/travis/node/build'
[ 1/19] deps/v8/libv8.a:  -> build/default/deps/v8/libv8.a
gcc -o obj/release/dtoa-config.o -c -Werror -Wno-uninitialized -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -ansi -m32 -DV8_TARGET_ARCH_IA32 -DENABLE_LOGGING_AND_PROFILING -Isrc src/dtoa-config.c
In file included from /usr/include/features.h:354,
                 from /usr/include/endian.h:22,
                 from src/dtoa-config.c:42:
/usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory
scons: *** [obj/release/dtoa-config.o] Error 1
Waf: Leaving directory `/home/travis/node/build'
Build failed
 -> task failed (err #2): 
	{task: deps/v8/libv8.a  -> libv8.a}
make: *** [all] Error 1</code></pre>

<p>Right out of the box.  Errors are popping up.  The problem is the missing <code>gnu/stubs-32.h</code> file.  Having this problem introduced me to a slick Ubuntu package called <code>apt-file</code>.  It works like <code>yum whatprovides</code> in Centos.  Once you install it and run <code>apt-file update</code>, finding missing files is a snap.  Case in point, our missing <code>gnu-stubs-32.h</code> file is located in <code>libc6-dev-i368</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-file find gnu/stubs-32.h
libc6-dev-i386: /usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h</code></pre>

<p>Now just a matter of installing that and running make again:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
... output from installation ...
$ make
Waf: Entering directory `/home/travis/node/build'
[ 1/19] deps/v8/libv8.a:  -> build/default/deps/v8/libv8.a
gcc ... etc., etc.</code></pre>

<p>This starts to look promising.  A bunch of compile commands are issued and it looks like V8 is now compiling properly.  Until this hits my terminal a few minutes later:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -o obj/release/mksnapshot -m32 obj/release/mksnapshot.o obj/release/libraries.o
obj/release/dtoa-config.o obj/release/accessors.o obj/release/allocation.o
... etc., etc., etc., then ...

/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3.3/libstdc++.a when searching for -lstdc++

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
scons: *** [obj/release/mksnapshot] Error 1
Waf: Leaving directory `/home/travis/node/build'
Build failed
 -> task failed (err #2): 
	{task: deps/v8/libv8.a  -> libv8.a}
make: *** [all] Error 1</code></pre>

<p>So now it looks like we don't have the 32-bit version of the <code>libstdc++</code> package.  apt-file to the rescue again, this time with some grep magic to help filter down the results.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-file find libstdc++.so | grep 32 | egrep -v "gcc|ppu|dbg"
ia32-libs: /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.5
ia32-libs: /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.5.0.7
lib32stdc++6: /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6
lib32stdc++6: /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6.0.10</code></pre>

<p>At this point I'm left guessing.  I go with <code>lib32stdc++6</code> because it's newer.  Makes sense to me, but I get the same output from <code>make</code> after I install it.  Off to Google I go.</p>

<p>Since V8 seems to be the culprit, I start there in my searches.  Searching around for issues compiling V8 on Ubuntu, I turn up <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=22">this bug post</a> that's closed as fixed.  It doesn't immediately help, but searches keep sending me back to it.  I finally notice that I was compiling <code>mksnapshot</code> when I get the error and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=22#c6">this comment</a> mentions <code>snapshot=off</code>.</p>

<p>Now I've got something to go on.  Sure enough, Node's wscript file explicitly passes in <code>snapshot=on</code>.  I change that to off and oh happy day, I make it past the V8 compile.</p>

<p>The happy day fell on the winter solstice or some such as it's short-lived.  I get to the final step of the compile and get practically the same message:</p>

<pre><code>[19/19] cxx_link: build/default/src/node_5.o build/default/src/events_5.o build/default/src/http_5.o build/default/src/net_5.o build/default/src/file_5.o build/default/src/timer_5.o build/default/src/process_5.o build/default/src/constants_5.o -> build/default/node

make: *** [all] Error 1</code></pre>

<p>At this point I'm perplexed.  I start asking around on IRC and end up chatting with <a href="http://netevil.org/">Wez</a> for a bit.  He knows a think or two about building code and starts leading me down the right path, but isn't able to provide the silver bullet that fixes my problems.</p>

<p>Next stop is the #ubuntu IRC channel.  They're busy helping someone get Flash working on their desktop so there isn't much help there.</p>

<p>At this point I'm trying to think of different ways to word my search.  I phrase it as plain English and end up searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=g%2B%2B+unable+to+find+32-bit+libstdc+ubuntu">g++ unable to find 32-bit libstdc ubuntu</a>.  The second result is titled <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1123473">g++ -m32 not finding lib32stdc++ libraries?</a> and is on the official Ubuntu forums site.  We might just have a winner.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the first response mentions the missing symlink.  A quick <code>ln -s</code>, and we're off.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so</code></pre>

<p>Ran <code>make</code>, and low-and-behold, it worked!  There goes 6 hours of my life between the two evenings I devoted to figuring it out.  Hope this post keeps someone else from having to spin their wheels as much as I did.</p>

<p>If you've made it this far and you're still reading, you might be wondering why I went to all of this trouble to track this down.  Well, the answer is simple, I'm really curious to see how well Node actually performs.  Now that I've got it running, expect to see some benchmarks soon.</p>

        <title>Breaking News: Kansas Governor Supports Profanity, Nudity, and Violence on State Website!</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/06/25/breaking-news-kansas-governor-supports-p/"/>
        <updated>2009-06-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/06/25/breaking-news-kansas-governor-supports-p</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shocking, I know, but it's true.  Earlier today, <a href="http://www.governor.ks.gov/">Kansas Governor Mark Parkinson</a> participated in an online chat in which he admitted it.  I asked why he did not have any blog-like features on his self-styled blog (which Artur Bagyants properly <a href="http://twitter.com/Bagyants/status/2299136102">deemed an e-newsletter</a>) such as commenting.  His full response can be <a href="http://www.ktka.com/chats/2009/jun/25/governor_mark_parkinson/">read in the chat transcript</a>, but here's the interesting part:</p>

<blockquote><p>I've received lots of input [after the launch of the site] that to be a real blog we need to make it interactive. We're looking at that possibility right now. I would love to know what people are thinking but we have to balance that with the very real fact that there are inappropriate postings all over the web. We're trying to figure out if there is a way to make the blog interactive and still keep it [to only brief nudity, some acts of violence, and the occassional use of profanity].</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Ok, so he didn't really say that.  It was actually that he wanted to "still keep it at least PG rated," which as <a href="http://jakelowen.com/">Jake Lowen</a> points out includes what I just attributed to him.  I believe everyone who read what he wrote understood what he meant, but things still get taken out of context.  By not having comments on his &quot;blog&quot; directly, he can limit the official exposure he gives to such trivial content.</p>

<p>I'm sure there's also the fear that someone'll post a link to goatsee pictures or some such and ok, that's fair enough.  But that's what comes with the territory.  The world, including the Internet, is full of crazy people.  Deal with it.  Someone posts a link to an offensive site, take it down.  Someone uses language that's beyond what you deem polite, edit it.  Publicly, though.  Make sure you replace the text with something that shows its been edited.</p>

<p>This isn't that hard.  Blogging is about being out there.  He acknowledged that in <a href="http://www.governor.ks.gov/News/Blog/blog090622.htm">his first post</a>.  He said he'd be the only one posting with his name.  Anyone else posting would be posting with their name.  Bravo!  He's sticking by his content as his.  That's great.  But... That's only part of the battle.  Enable unmoderated comments and reserve the right to take anything down.  Afterall, we're stepping into your domain (pardon the pun).  Don't put up with it people screwing around on your site, but don't discourage the conversation right off the bat.</p>

        <title>Fuck off, humanity!</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/06/19/fuck-off-humanity/"/>
        <updated>2009-06-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/06/19/fuck-off-humanity</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update</strong>:As pointed out by a commenter, the original post seems to have been a hoax.  On the one hand, I'm glad this didn't actually take place, on the other, I'm saddened because it didn't seem that out of the realm of possibility.</em></p>

<p><em>Author's note: This is for me, and me alone.  Don't like it?  Don't agree?  Replace "humanity" in the title with your name.</em></p>

<p><strong>There, I said it.  I just got through reading <a href="http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-getting-really-fed-up-of-things-like.html">this post</a> (warning, you'll hate humanity after reading it).  Seriously people, what the fuck is your problem?</strong></p>

<p>Ok.  I'll use my inside voice now.  If you've read this blog for a long time, you know that I am firmly in the gay rights camp (it's equal protection under the law, stupid).  I've been taunted in some posts for it, called names, had family members "pray for me", etc., etc.  But the one that gets me: I've been asked "you're not gay, why do you care?"</p>

<blockquote><p>She rode her bike to go to the store. She never came home. They found her bike in a dumpster. Late that evening they found her. She had been assaulted with a sledge hammer, they think, judging from the bruises all over her body. Her knee caps had been broken. She had been gang raped. They buried her alive.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why do I care?  Cause there's a family right now that's reeling from tragedy upon tragedy.  Their father just died, their mother was maimed, and now their daughter was tortured, gang raped, then buried alive.  Think about that for a minute.  She had both of her knee caps broken with a sledge hammer, then buried alive.</p>

<p>Why do I care?  More importantly, why the <strong>fuck</strong> don't you?</p>

<p>Recently a friend of mine came out to their parents.  Their mom broke down in to tears.  Not because of any disappointment or anything like that, but because she was worried.  She was worried that the world was a mean place, and that people would be mean to them and their partner.  When I heard that for the first time, I chuckled.  I live in a little bubble in Lawrence.  That doesn't happen here.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-getting-really-fed-up-of-things-like.html">this</a> is why their mom thought that.  This is what went through her mind.  What century is it again?  Are we not above this?  Have certain parts of our species not evolved past grunts and pointing?</p>

<p>Right now all I want to do is think of insanely violent and cruel things to do to the people who did this.  It doesn't serve a purpose, but it makes me feel better.  Makes me feel like I have some sort of control over this blue marble.</p>

<blockquote><p>She worked her way out of the almost grave and crawled for three hours to get help. She was put in the ICU and given little chance to survive. Last night she died.</p></blockquote>

<p>She dug herself out of the grave and crawled for 3 hours.  She got help.  Then she died.</p>

<p>Has an amazing what's it all for feeling to it.</p>

        <title>My goals for the PHP standards group</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/06/02/my-goals-for-the-php-standards-group/"/>
        <updated>2009-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/06/02/my-goals-for-the-php-standards-group</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago at php|tek, I corralled developers from all of the major PHP frameworks into one of the conferences rooms.  The idea was simple: in the PEAR Group we've been discussing our new PEAR2 Coding Standard and have come to some conclusions on how PHP 5.3 code should be handled moving forward.  A standard is only a standard if people use it, though, and PEAR is not entirely representative of the community at large.</p>

<p>That's where this group comes in.  By having official representatives from PEAR, Agavi, Cake, Solar, and Zend Framework and unofficial representation from Phing and Symfony, we had a good cross section.  I went into the meeting with 3 items I wanted to pick off, which were, in order:</p>

<ol><li>Namespace usage and package/component naming structures</li>
<li>Naming of classes, interfaces, and abstracts</li>
<li>Naming standards for Exceptions</li></ol>

<p>I had hoped that we'd make it through the first one, but fully anticipated it taking longer.  About 20 minutes into the meeting, we were already moving on to the second item!  We flew through the list and were all extremely energized by our productivity.  We decided to form an official group of our projects to oversee the creation of this standard and work toward better, more widely adopted standards across our projects.</p>

<p>We also decided to setup a mailing list.  Given all of our experience with the proletariat, we decided to make the list moderated.  This has proven to be the biggest flash-point so far, drawing <a href="http://news.php.net/php.standards/29">criticism from the creator of PHP</a>, himself.</p>

<p>For better, or worst, I stand by my decision to vote for a moderated list. Below is what my vision is.  It's my vision and mine alone, but this is where I'm coming from.  I posted it earlier this morning to the internal list that we've started to discuss moving these standards forward.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'd love to see an officially sanctioned standard come out of our work.  All of us are too busy, both with real jobs and our various projects, to fight the battles that come of trying to make this a completely open process where anyone with an email address can contribute.  Sad as it may be, pear-dev has demonstrated that coding standards *must* go the way of sausages and laws lest they devolve into a constant "but I think &lt;insert favorite coding standard pet peeve> is better, and this is why..." followed by pages of well meaning, but generally irrelevant content. </p>

<p>My reason for wanting a standard is simple, I move among other coding communities in addition to PHP and I am constantly put in a position that I must defend PHP against criticisms that it is unmaintainable, barely useable, and only useful if the least common denominator is your sole concern.  Needless to say, I think those are opinions are misguided at best, and patently wrong at worst; but then someone looks at WordPress or phpBB or &lt;insert favorite "I'm amazed it actually runs" project written in PHP> source code and has all their criticisms validated. </p>

<p>As a community, we need to be able to come together and agree on a coding standard.  When code is published for public consumption in a year, I would love it if the first comment on blog posts or mailing list messages announcing the new code is "wow, that's great, but you should run it through phpcs."  In Python it's not uncommon for pastebin'd code or newly published code to have a response "read pep 8."  They aren't trying to be mean or petty, they're just trying to guide someone down the path to good citizenship in the Python community.</p>

<p>Given it's frigid&mdash;even hostile in some cases&mdash;reception, it does look like having an official coding standard for frameworks and libraries is our best outcome.  Hopefully, with the projects in the community we have behind this we'll be able to build up a consensus and prove our decisions the correct ones.  If not, then at least we've expanded the number of projects we can easy move between out from our small enclaves to a wider swath of the PHP landscape.</p>

        <title>Magic is to Python as Java is to PHP</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/05/13/magic-is-to-python-as-java-is-to-php/"/>
        <updated>2009-05-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/05/13/magic-is-to-python-as-java-is-to-php</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow.  I touched a live wire today in IRC without meaning to.  I lamented over the inconsistency that <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> has between it's generic views.  It has to do with what the Python community calls <em>magic</em> and goes something like this.</p>

<p>Django ships with these great generic views (if you're coming from another web framework, consider their views as controllers).  Working with any framework long enough, you know that there's only so much to do.  Handle posts to update, grab a list of objects or a single object, pass them off to the presentation layer, hand it off to designers and call it a day.  They work great.</p>

<p>There's a series of generic views for handling object updating and deleting.  They're the <code>django.views.generic.create_update</code> views.  Of course, you don't want just anybody updating your content, so you probably want to be able to require that users are logged in.  Easy enough, add the <code>login_required</code> variable to the dictionary of options you specify for the view and call it a day.  One line of code in the dictionary that both your add and edit rely on and you're done.</p>

<p>Until you get to the list of objects.  It's located over in <code>django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list</code> and it complains rabidly when you include a <code>login_required</code> value.  Turns out, that generic view doesn't support what seems like an obvious option to modify it's behavior.  After all, you might not want lists of your objects just floating around out there.  It's an inconsistency between the generic views, and annoyed me.</p>

<p>I mentioned something to that effect on IRC and ended up in a lengthy discussion about it.  Turns out there is an acknowledged inconsistency, but the problem is that the <code>create_update</code> views take <code>login_required</code> rather than the <code>list_detail</code> is missing it.  There's a perfectly acceptable way to fix it: decorators.</p>

<p>There's a problem with this, though.  Decorators have multiple syntaxes.  The <em>convenient</em> way to do them is like this:</p>

<pre><code>@login_required
def some_view(request):
    ...
</code></pre><p><br /></p>

<p>In a generic view where you're referencing a function that's already declared, that doesn't work.  Instead, you have to declare it like this:</p>

<pre><code>login_required(some_view)</code></pre><p><br /></p>

<p>Still doesn't seem horrible, but here's the catch.  Everywhere else you work with URL patterns in Django, the tendency is to refer to the view as a string.  Note that the parameter to <code>login_required</code> isn't a string.  That means you have to explicitly import the views you want to use, otherwise Python has no way of knowing where that function exists.</p>

<p>That personally offended my sense of code aesthetics.  I mentioned it and said that I would just allow <code>login_required</code> to be there.  It's ubiquitous enough that it seems like it should be available all of the time, for every view that accepts parameters.</p>

<p>That was quickly shown to have errors as there were two ways to handle that:</p>

<ol><li>Every view everyone will ever write in every Django application everywhere must take a "login_required" argument and include the appropriate code to handle it.</li>
<li>Anybody who wants the behavior can do "login_required(some_function)"</li></ol>

<p>That's the two obvious ones.  I added the third.</p>

<ol start="3"><li>or, the framework looks for the presence of login_required and decorates the function appropriately</li></ol>

<p>And thus I touched the live wire and <em>magic</em> missiles started flying.  If you're reading this post via <a href="http://planet-php.org/">Planet PHP</a> and you've made it this far, you're undoubtedly wondering what all this Python and Django talk has to do with PHP.  Well, it has to do with magic and Java.</p>

<p>See in PHP circles, the quickest way to end a discussion is to say that some piece of code acts or looks too much like Java.  Try to code in object-oriented PHP and risk being dismissed with "PHP isn't Java".  Once that's thrown into the conversation, you might as well call it quits.  Java is tainted goods in PHP community.  The culture is such that it's shear mention is enough to send shivers down the spine of aspiring PHP'ers.</p>

<p>That shiver inducing phrase in Python appears to be "magic."  Be explicit, that's their motto.  Doing anything without explicitly asking for it is considered "magic" and should be shunned like a leper with the plague.  To be flip, you could change it around to "I'm fine, I can do it myself, leave me alone."</p>

<p>Me personally, I'm lazy.  I like having hooks deep into a system where I can apply things at will.  I think things like the user authentication system should be able to add framework-wide hooks so when a <code>login_required</code> is encountered in the parameters it can auto-magically make sure that the user is authenticated.  I love it when a framework takes work away from me, that's why I use them in the first place.</p>

<p>I've always been slightly amused and distressed at the PHP community's need to shun Java.  As an outsider to the other communities, I've often wondered what set them off.  Now I've found at least one in Python and I'll keep my eyes open as I start my foray into Ruby to see what sets them off.  Guess this just does show how similar all us geeks really are.  Different words, same reactions.</p>

<p>Random question to my readers (all five of you): do you do Ruby?  If so, what's the sacred cows there?</p>

        <title>Race Report: God's Country Duathalon</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/04/26/race-report-god-s-country-duathalon/"/>
        <updated>2009-04-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/04/26/race-report-god-s-country-duathalon</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow.  It's been a <b>long</b> time since I've written one of these.  Yesterday I participated in my first race in near (if not over) two years!  Time flies, etc.</p>

<p>Yesterday wasn't a traditional mountain bike race, it was a duathalon.  God's Country Duathalon, 4 mile trail run, 12 mile mountain bike loop.  Before you go getting all impressed at my multi-sport abilities: I didn't run, I raced a relay.  A friend of ours is training for the Lincoln Marathon, which is next week, so the 4 mile trail run was a nice warm-up for the real festivities.</p>

<p>If yesterday's run is any indication, she'll do great next week.  I was hoping for a sub 40 minute time and she came in at a touch over 35 minutes.  I knew there was at least one co-ed team in front of us, so I was off.  The River Trails are really fun for 29'ers.  You get in the big ring and never leave it.  The lowest gear I hit the whole race was 44x28.  It's a really ripping course.</p>

<p>We did a lap and a half.  The first lap I picked off at least 30 riders.  Most of 'em were solo, but I saw a few 700 numbers on legs as I went by.  It felt amazing to be riding against a clock that wasn't on my handlebars again.  It's been way too long for that feeling.</p>

<p>I wasn't running a clock, so I don't have the exact time, but I believe I turned the 8 mile lap in a bit under 35 minutes.  The half lap was good too.  Before I knew, I'd covered the two miles to the turn around and was heading back.  I got caught up in a few places where riders were starting to pile up which lost a bit of time, but everyone's out there to race, so ya can't complain.  Once I hit the levy for the two mile leg back, I turned it up.  There was one guy about 200 yards in front of me that I couldn't close down any gap on, but I pulled in another 6 or 7 riders there too.  The 29'er wheels with a 44 big ring really leg ya crank it out on those long straight aways.</p>

<p>We ended up with 2nd place.  I was 51 seconds off of closing down the gap to first place.  Really makes me wonder if that wasn't the guy who was up in front of me that I didn't catch on the levy.  If that's the case, we were about 100' away from each other on the singletrack and I was closing.  Too bad there wasn't more single track. :-)</p>

<p>I'm happy though.  I felt strong and pulled us into 3rd place in the overall relay and 2nd in the co-ed.  Out of some 9 or 10 relay teams, I'll take it.</p>

<p>With the leg only being 12 miles, it felt really short.  The last race I did was the twelve hour race in Gallup as part of a team.  I think I put in right at six hours on the bike that day.  There was a mountain bike race after the duathalon, and though my legs still felt good, I knew I didn't have that kind of juice in 'em for two short races.  Now, had this one gone for another 12 or even 24 miles, I'd have been stoked.</p>

<p>It's nice to see that the legs are still there, even with all of the neglect and abuse I've given them in the last few years.  The nice thing is that I really think my lungs are just high altitude only at this point.  I pushed my legs a few times into the red zone yesterday, but my heart and lungs were in great shape.  I don't think it'd take much to get back into race shape again.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this won't be the last of these for the year.  I have a few races in mind I'd like to make, just a matter of everything lining up properly.</p>

        <title>Starting a New Chapter</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/03/30/starting-a-new-chapter/"/>
        <updated>2009-03-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/03/30/starting-a-new-chapter</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever read a book where there's an empty page between chapters?  You finish the chapter, turn the next page, and nothing's there.  Quickly, you turn to the next page to make sure your book didn't ship with a page that went unprinted.  It didn't, but it does give you that brief moment of pause.</p>

<p>I just turned to a blank page.  I know there's a new chapter getting ready to start, but I'm going to take a moment to savor the green field that is that blank page.  This week is my last <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time and done a lot of soul searching, and just felt that it isn't the correct place for me right now.  The team at Ning is truly amazing.  I've never worked on a team with as much depth as the one they've assembled.  Everyone there is a rock star.  That said, I need something different.</p>

<p>I don't know what's next... yet.  There's lots of great ideas out there and I have a few personal projects I want to spend some time on:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://phpt.info/">PHPT</a> is is dire need of finishing and documenting.  It runs, but doesn't handle everything in php-src which is it's true test.</li>
<li>I want to spend a bit of time with <a href="http://github.com/tswicegood/yabt">YABT</a>.  I've got some ideas I want to try out and see if they work.</li>
<li>I've been "learning" Cocoa and Objective C for something like 5 months now, I want to get actually get proficient in it as there's a few apps that no one else has done yet that I'm going to write.</li>
<li>I'm getting the itch to write more.  That means more blogging and I have a few ideas swirling about for books.  I said I'd never spend another summer writing, but I might just if one of these ideas gets some traction.</li>
<li>And as they say... <em>and so much more</em>.</li></ul>

<p>Sounds like tons to do.  Of course, I can't spend all of my time working on my pet projects, unless I find a benefactor/patron (and if you fit that description and are looking for someone to sponsor, please do <a href="travis@domain51.com?subject=I'll be your Sugar Daddy/Mama">email me</a>), so if you're looking for a senior level PHP dev and have an interesting concept, <a href="mailto:travis@domain51.com?subject=My company is ___...&amp;body=And we're unique because ___.">drop me a line</a> or leave a comment.</p>

        <title>CoreNetworks.net: This customer's perspective</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/03/03/corenetworks-net-this-customer-s-perspec/"/>
        <updated>2009-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/03/03/corenetworks-net-this-customer-s-perspec</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following this blog as religiously as I'm sure you all do, you know that from <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/10/07/the-ol-bait-and-switch-twister-group-is-">time to time</a> I get pissed off at the service I receive and use this blog to vent about it.  This isn't one of those posts.</p>

<p>For the last few years I've had a dedicated host at <a href="http://corenetworks.net/">CoreNetworks.net</a>.  I host my <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/">PEAR channel</a>, my private Git repositories that I use to share things between computers, and a few miscellaneous things on the server.  There's nothing major there, but there's a lot of stuff I don't want to lose.</p>

<p>My server runs Ubuntu Server Edition.  For what I use it for, it's great.  The packages stay up-to-date, the server keeps itself running, I'm happy.  I was going on 6 month uptime cycles.  Up for 6 months, do a distro upgrade, reboot, and be up for another 6 months.  For whatever reason, I didn't get this last upgrade in.  Sunday, I decided to fix it.</p>

<p>I checked the upgrade process to make sure it hadn't changed.  Sure enough, it hadn't.  A quick <code>sudo do-release-upgrade</code> and I was off to the races.  That's when it all started.</p>

<p>My root partition was full.  I started poking around to find out what was filling it up.  All of the usual suspects were on their own partition and had plenty of room.  I'd only allocated 500Mb to my root partition as I <em>thought</em> nothing important was going to end up on it.</p>

<div class="center" style="margin-bottom:1em;"><a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/status/1267014657"><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/server-twitter-status-1.jpg" width="400px" alt="Umm... this might not be good. Just moved /lib to /usr/lib2 and tried to symlink it (partitioning issues). ln can't run, nor ls :-/ #ubuntu" /></a></div>

<p>After a few minutes of investigation I found the <code>/lib</code> directory.  It was taking up a little over 80% of my 500Mb.  Simple enough fix.  A quick <code>mv /lib /usr/lib2</code> and a <code>ln -s /usr/lib2 /lib</code> and I would be done.  No harm in that.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>As soon as the <code>mv</code> finished, I went to create the symlink and got an error.  <code>ln</code> wasn't found.  I tried an <code>ls</code> and got the same message.  At that point I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.  <code>cd</code> still worked, but not much else.  Anything that's part of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> was gone.</p>

<p>Now panic started to set it.</p>

<div class="center" style="margin-bottom:1em;"><a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/status/1267062855"><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/server-twitter-status-2.jpg" width="400px" alt="Seriously?! WTF #ubuntu. Am I *so* far out of date that I incorrectly assumed you wouldn't put anything in the fucking / directory?!" /></a></div>

<p>For those of you who <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">follow me</a> on Twitter, you'll recognize that I was a little miffed.  I keep cursing to an absolute minimum on my Twitter account.  Sure, I've only got 140 characters to fill with an update, but I don't have to be so lazy that I can't come up with something other than cursing to fill a post.</p>

<p>I hopped on the #ubuntu IRC channel and asked what my options were.  Boot to a LiveCD was the only semi-helpful answer I got.  The server's located in California, so that's why it's only semi-helpful.  It's not like I can pop a CD in the drive and reboot it.  My favorite response was someone trying to be clever with their &quot;that's much more creative than rm -rf /&quot; comment.  Sure, in retrospect it was, but that's not the answer I was looking for at the time.</p>

<p>I called a buddy of mine who's a sysadmin, and <a href="http://traviscline.com/blog/">T2</a> and <a href="http://ericholscher.com/">Eric</a> showed up at my front door.  They'd seen my prolific cursing in a private IRC channel and wanted to come over and heckle&mdash;err, I mean help.</p>

<p>Now, to bring this back full circle to <a href="http://corenetworks.net/">CoreNetworks</a>.  I determined my best bet was going to be the LiveCD via <abbr title="Keyboard Video Mouse">KVM</abbr>.  It basically lets you act like you're sitting there with a keyboard, video (i.e., monitor), and mouse hooked up to the machine.  I checked the CN website looking for a phone number and couldn't find one.  I fired off an email to their support email address asking if it would be possible to get a KVM instance going with a LiveCD and asked them to please call my cell if it was possible.</p>

<p>I need to back up just a minute to bring you fully up-to-date.  Unless you've clicked on one of the links to <a href="http://corenetworks.net/">CoreNetworks</a>, you probably haven't heard of them.  They're a dedicated hosting provided that provides excellent prices on dedicated machines.  They have one server that starts at $29.95 a month!  When I first started having web sites hosted, that's how much it cost for a shared account!</p>

<p>They don't offer lots of fancy extras, and it's just a plain ol' box.  They're not bottom of the barrel on prices, but they're nowhere near the top.  Their network is reliable, I've never noticed any major downtime on it.  All of this for a really reasonable price.  I don't have their $29.95 server, I pay a few bucks more for one of their upgraded machines, but it's still very low for what I get.</p>

<p>I've never had an urgent request go in to support in the time I've been using their service.  At that, I think the only reasons I've ever contacted them were billing related (credit card expired and one time they randomly shut me off for an hour saying I hadn't paid my bill when I had).  I had no idea how my email would be received.  I honestly didn't expect a response until Monday.</p>

<p>About 5 minutes later I got a call from a number I didn't recognize.  My heart jumped at the thought it might be them.  Sure enough, one of the guys in support had seen my email and was wanting to verify what I wanted, then set off to get it going.  Another 5 minutes and I had an email with instructions to connect to my KVM and told me that the LiveCD was loaded!</p>

<p>With that, it was a few quick commands to get the files back in the right place and reboot and it was done.  Piece of cake with the KVM+LiveCD, but still, my heart skipped a few beats when I realized what had happened right after I saw that first error message.</p>

<p>This was amazing customer service, though.  These guys won a customer for life by going above and beyond my wildest expectations for them.  This is all from a provider that doesn't have a flashy web site.  They don't push anything as whiz-bang or the latest gizmo.  I doubt the words <em>cloud</em> or <em>elastic</em> appear anywhere on their site.  I've never noticed a banner ad for them on any of the development websites I frequent.</p>

<p>The only time I've ever heard mention of them is when a friend of mine pointed me in their direction saying that they offered solid services at a great price.  I've always recommended them to friends when they ask about hosting.  Given this past weekend's experience, I wanted to recommend them to a broader audience.</p>

<p>I can't recommend <a href="http://corenetworks.net/">CoreNetworks</a> highly enough if you have a need for a dedicated server.  It's reliable, and, should you need it, their support is excellent.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library.  The bug is most likely in your application.</p></blockquote>

<p>That's the 26<sup>th</sup> tip from Pragmatic Programmers.  There's a funny story on pages 96 - 97 about an engineer who spent weeks trying to work around a bug he thought he'd found in the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a> operating system.  After all of his work arounds failed, he was forced to go back over the documentation.  It's then that he found out what he was doing wrong and promptly fixed the problem.</p>

<p>I read that story some half decade or more ago now, but I'd do good to remember it more often.  My mind jumps to the fanciful because it's more interesting.  Chasing down bugs in the language or database or someone else's code means you get to play with new stuff, and what's more important to my subconscious is that it means I didn't write the bad code.</p>

<p>Working in new languages often brings this type of issue up.  Those first few toy scripts I write working through a book or online tutorial often fail.  I look over my code, find the problem, and fix it.  Once I've got a little bit of a handle on the language, though, I revert.  This just happened to me.</p>

<p>I'm still working on my site.  Today I decided to refactor my <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> integration into something a little more robust.  xmerl has proven unreliable in odd cases and I've read a lot of good things about <a href="http://erlsom.sourceforge.net/">Erlsom</a>, so I completely rewrote my XML parsing code to use Erlsom instead of xmerl, moved my <code>main_controller.erl</code> over to use the new code, and started running it.  Had a few simple errors, then I ran into a nasty error being thrown by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/erlydtl/">ErlyDTL</a>:</p>

<pre><code>
crasher:
    pid: &lt;0.93.0>
    registered_name: []
    exception error: no function clause matching 
                     proplists:get_value(square,
... snipped ...
</code></pre>
<p></p>

<p>And a huge big tuple followed that.  I ran the code again, same error.  Switched back over to the compiler, ran the code that was generated the square tuple and it came back fine.  If you're familiar with <code>proplists:get_value()</code> or ErlyDTL, you already know the problem.  I was passing in a tuple instead of a list.  The fix is two characters changed, but I was already a few hours into a hacking session, about the time I should have been taking a break, but instead, I was off to the races.</p>

<p>I tracked the code down to erlydtl_runtime:fetch_value/2.  Ahh, it only handles atoms and <a href="http://erlsom.sourceforge.net/">Erlsom</a> returns the keys in its key/value pairs as lists.  Simple enough condition to check for on an error and recover from.  Wrote that up, tested it in the compiler, everything worked there.  Loaded it up, still getting errors.</p>

<p>An hour later I discovered the tuple to list error.  I got so caught up in the problem being somewhere else that I missed the obvious information right in front of me.</p>

        <title>Playing with BeepBeep and Flickr</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/01/02/playing-with-beepbeep-and-flickr/"/>
        <updated>2009-01-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/01/02/playing-with-beepbeep-and-flickr</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love playing with <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.  I don't have much occasion to use it, but then a perfect opportunity presented itself.  <a href="http://blog.accordingtomegan.com/">Meg</a> and I bought a house, and me being the eternal geek that I am thought it'd be fun to build a site that aggregates all of the content we generate on our blogs, flickr, etc., that have to do with the house.  I could write a site in PHP that does this in a few hours, but where's the fun in that?  Instead, I've decided to implement it in <a href="http://github.com/davebryson/beepbeep/">BeepBeep</a>, a new Erlang, convention over configuration framework.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with BeepBeep, don't worry&mdash;not many people are.  It's the framework I would have built for Erlang had <a href="http://weblog.miceda.org/">Dave Bryson</a> not done it for me.  It uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/">MochiWeb</a> for HTTP, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/erlydtl/">ErlyDTL</a>&mdash;an Erlang version of the Django Template Language&mdash;for templating, and a router to translate URLs into a controller and action.  The result?  This:</p>

<div class="image_block"><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/BeepBeep Flickr.jpg" alt="" title="" width="322" height="437" /></div><p> </p>

<p>Ok - so it doesn't look like much, but those 20 images are being generated off of <a href="http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=lawrencee12th&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=atom">this feed</a> of photos from Flickr.  It's nothing special, except that I had never worked with <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/xmerl/index.html">xmerl</a> until this past week and it'd been nearly a year since I'd done anything with <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/index.html">Mnesia</a>.  What do those have to do with Flickr?  Well, there's no Flickr module for Erlang (yet), so I have to parse the raw XML that Flickr generates and I don't want to do that every request, so I'm using Mnesia to cache the photos from Flickr locally.</p>

<p>I had originally started out with an in-memory cache for the photos, but this evening I rewrote the entire lib_cache module of my app to use Mnesia.  I still need to do the code that handles expiration, but that's coming.  Once I have that in place, I'll be ready to rock.  I don't have <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> installed on this computer or I would do up a diagram of the code.  I'll save that for another post. :-)</p>

<p>Concurrency oriented programming is definitely fun.  At <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>, we're always keeping an eye out for that sort of programming because of the <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/ning.com/?metric=uv">volume of users</a> we have to deal with.  Why make a user wait when you can spawn off job in the background to do things like update caches, change data structures, and so on?  The fact that we're doing this in a language such as PHP just goes to show that it really is what you're doing with the language, not the language itself, but there's a part of me that wonders what would happen if a site like Ning was coded in a language such as Erlang that's built for concurrency.</p>

<p>But I digress.  I've got some cool plans for my little BeepBeep site.  Keep an eye on this space for more articles as the site comes together.</p>

        <title>One Year - Three Hundred Sixty Five Photos</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2009/01/01/one-year-three-hundred-sixty-five-photos/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2009/01/01/one-year-three-hundred-sixty-five-photos</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<br /><blockquote>People will often say that their whole lives flashed before their eyes after they experienced a traumatic event. Perhaps it's a bit morbid, but we think that sounds pretty incredible.</blockquote>

That's taken from <a href="http://www.photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day">this post</a> that introduces people to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/project_365/">Project 365</a>.  Project 365 is one of the undertakings for 2009 that I alluded to in <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/12/31/2008-a-retrospective">my last post</a>.  The goal is simple.  Take and share at least one photo, every day, all year long.  At the end of the year, you've got an amazing collection that shows your year.  Here's my first entry:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tswicegood/3157201391/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3152/3157201391_7051db4ee6.jpg?v=0" alt="Ingredient Shadows" /></a>

I took the shot at Ingredient as Meg an I were finishing up a late lunch.  I'm pleased with it, so now the bar is set pretty high for the rest of the year.  All of my photos are going to be published to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tswicegood/sets/72157611973559115/">my 365 set</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> if you're keen on watching this little experiment.

        <title>2008: A retrospective</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/12/31/2008-a-retrospective/"/>
        <updated>2008-12-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/12/31/2008-a-retrospective</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One year gone.  As I'm sure most of these types of posts say, this year's been crazy.  I got <a href="http://blog.accordingtomegan.com/">married to my best friend</a>, took a job at <a href="http://www.ning.com/">a great start-up</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">wrote a book</a>, and bought a house!  Talk about a banner year.</p>

<p>I discovered a lot about myself.  One, writing on my blog isn't as much fun when writing becomes work.  I thought I would blog a lot more about the book writing experience, but after putting in an 8 (or 12) hour day at my day job and spending 2 - 4 hours writing after that, writing here wasn't the release it once was.</p>

<p>The book's over though, so now I've got no good excuse.  My <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> is full of ideas for blog posts.  This next year, I'm going to get some of those down on "paper" to share.  Of course, those posts are in addition to <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">the copious amount of posts</a> I make on Twitter.</p>

<p>Back in January, the <a href="http://traviscline.com/">other Travis</a> and I started up <a href="http://lawrence.ning.com/group/programmers">Lawrence Programmers</a>.  It's a language agnostic group of geeks.  We started with a monthly schedule, but didn't find out groove until the summer.  Lawrence Programmers Drinking Nights (LPDN) are a weekly get together to grab food and some beverages and BS about geek stuff.  It's been great getting to know the local geeks better.</p>

<p>There's all sorts of other things too.  Didn't spend nearly enough time on my bike, but got Meg hooked on hers.  Contributed ideas to a lot of software projects and spent some time playing with on my own stuff.  Learned Erlang and Python well enough to hack in both.  And I'm sure in my drug-induced stupor (God bless cold medicine), I've barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I've got a few new things planned for 2009.  I'll fill you in on them as they come to fruition.  In the meantime, I leave you with this <a href="http://lawrence.com/podcasts/punditocracy/2008/dec/30/2008-year-wouldnt-die/">auditory year-in-review</a> from the guys over at <a href="http://lawrence.com">Lawrence.com</a>  A note of warning: it is a little raw in some areas, so its not for those offended by such things as cursing or rick-rolls.</p>

<p>Happy 2009!</p>

        <title>Lots to say, almost no time to say it</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/11/22/lots-to-say-almost-no-time-to-say-it</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost.  I do have more time this week than I did the previous week, and even more than the week before that, and so on.  The last time I was out at <a href="http://www.ning.com/">HQ</a> someone who had just found out that I was <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git" title="Pragmatic Version Control using Git">writing a book</a> asked how in the world I had the time to do it.  What, with starting a new job at a start-up and all.  Quite honestly, I don't know how I managed.  The last few months have been little more than a blur.</p>

<p>Here's a few highlights.  As you know, America elected its first black President.  Hooray!  I didn't vote for him.  That's a whole other, guilt-ridden post that will come out at some point.</p>

<p>Around the same time I finished up <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git" title="Pragmatic Version Control using Git">my book</a>.  This past Tuesday I got the final draft after the layout guys had got it ready for publication.  According to the schedule I have, the printers should be setting it up as we speak.</p>

<p>Working with everyone at <a href="http://pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> has been an unbelievable honor and an amazing learning experience.  I thought I knew a fair amount about writing.  Working with professionals showed me exactly how much I didn't know.  Good thing I draw my monthly paycheck from another line of work.</p>

<p>This last week Meg and I put in an offer on a new house right off of downtown Lawrence and had it accepted.  There's a <em>great</em> story revolving around the offer process that, again, is a post unto itself.  We're set to close the first part of December assuming everything continues along smoothly.</p>

<p>It's a great, nearly 100-year-old house two blocks from the heart of Lawrence.  Stoked doesn't begin to describe how excited we both are, but there's some miscellaneous to take care of.  Speaking of which, if you know of anyone in Lawrence who would love a killer deal on a townhouse through July of '09, <a href="mailto:travis@domain51.com">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>On the code front, I've got back to coding for fun.  With the book and talks and everything that's been happening for the last few months I had almost forgot how much of a joy it is to sit down and hack on code just for the joy of creating something.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers, <a href="http://skife.org/">Brian McCallister</a>, created a mailing list for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/yet-another-bug-tracker">Yet Another Bug Tracker</a>, or yabt.  The last time I was in Cali we were talking about how we both wanted a simple bug tracker that stored everything in the repository.  Whenever you've got your code, you've got your tickets too.</p>

<p>Both of us have been kicking around the idea for years, he finally did something about it a few weeks ago and I've been playing with some code this week.  I <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/yet-another-bug-tracker/browse_thread/thread/962475852692b907#msg_276a9b44a666e872">posted</a> what I anticipate the initial <abbr title="command line interface">CLI</abbr> looking like.  If you're interested in participating, join up and share your thoughts.</p>

<p>Other than that, not much is happening around here.  I've got some much needed vacation time schedule for after Thanksgiving, just in time to get ready to move! :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been kind of quiet around here.  It's not that I haven't had much to say, it's that I haven't had the time to say it!  For those of you who <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">follow</a> <a href="http://plurk.com/tswicegood/">my</a> <a href="http://pownce.com/tswicegood">various</a> <a href="http://identi.ca/tswicegood">microblogs</a> probably even noticed a dip in updates over the last few weeks.  Every last ounce of energy has been put into the final push for the book and I had to cut back on the distractions to make it through.</p>

<p>Now that it's over, I get to pay attention to some majorly neglected areas.  First and foremost is my bike.  We're in the middle of a great fall here and I haven't gotten much riding in at all.  Note to self: write books in the winter, not the summer.</p>

<p>Next up is <a href="http://phpt.info/">PHPT</a>.  I've got a few people interested in helping out with it.  I'm still working toward 100% drop-in replacement for PHP's run-tests.php.  There's still a bit to go, but it's getting close.  I've got a little over a month to get it really rocking, though.  My <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/ts2/0">Testing the PHP Way: PHPT</a> tutorial was accepted to <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/index">php|works</a>, so the test suite had better be up to par before then. :-)</p>

<p>I'm also giving my <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s4/2">The Future is Not Yet Widely Distributed</a> talk in the <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule">agnostic track</a>&mdash;tracks that aren't PHP or Python specific.  The talk is an hour long introduction to Git.  Now that I've <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">written the book on Git</a>, I'd better be able to talk about it for at least an hour. :-D</p>

<p>I am planning on having both talks available as screencasts/video talks too for anyone who can't make it to the conference.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's the quick update.  Now that I'm not spending all of my free time writing, I can get back to writing some more here for fun.  Look for some posts on programming soon.  I'm going to be learning more about <a href="http://developer.ning.com/">OpenSocial</a> now that we're <a href="http://developer.ning.com/forum/topic/show?id=1185512%3ATopic%3A67606">supporting it in a big way @ Ning</a>.</p>

        <title>The ol' bait and switch: Twister Group is a fraud</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/10/07/the-ol-bait-and-switch-twister-group-is-/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/10/07/the-ol-bait-and-switch-twister-group-is-</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seems like every time I decide to give <a href="http://www.google.com/products">Google's Shopping</a> a try I end up getting screwed.  Had some issues with some luggage I ordered back at the beginning of the year, and this past week in some replacement filters I ordered for my earbuds.</p>

<p>The filters cost around $20 on Amazon.  A quick search of Google turned up <a href="http://www.thetwistergroup.com/product/ER6-I-50%20D38231.html">this listing</a> which still shows them as available.  $9.12 is a deal, but they charge nearly $20 in shipping.  I checked ordering multiple sets to see if that changed the shipping.  It didn't, so I went ahead and ordered three sets so I'd have plenty of spares around.</p>

<p>This morning I got an email, after my order had been shipped, telling me that they were only sending one set of filters.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Travis Swicegood,</p>

<p>We are sorry to inform you that we only had 1 of ER6-I-50 D38231 (ETYMOTIC RESEARCH ER6-I-50 REPLACEMENT FILTERS) which was shipped by FedEx: tracking # 753365065348. We refunded $19.52.</p>

<p>We apologize for inconvenience and thank you for your business.</p>

<p>The Twister Group</p></blockquote>

<p>Umm... nope.  That's a bait and switch.  You did the math and realized you just screwed yourself because you didn't adjust your shipping to cover the under wholesale cost.  I replied much the same.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello;<br />
 <br />
I made this purchase under the assumption that the large shipping fee was going to be offset by the ability to purchase multiple sets.  Canceling a portion of the order after it already shipped and been paid for is a bait and switch.<br />
 <br />
I would like to either receive the addition two packages of filters or a refund of 2/3rd of the shipping fee.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for your help in resolving this!<br />
-T</p></blockquote>

<p>I got a quick response from them.  It barely qualifies as coherent and ends by calling any attempt from me to recover the fees that they just cheated me out of.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you required us to either ship your order in full or not at all, you must have indicated so in the notes or by replying to order confirmation message. Since you failed to do so, our policy governs this order and the shipping charge stands.<br />
 <br />
As a matter of fact, it costs more than 1/3 of the rate to ship 1/3 of the weight. For instance, FedEx ground rate to deliver 3 lb package is about $8.50, while shipping 1lb package is&#133;You expect 1/3 which is about $3&#133; $8.50. Only $0.50 additional for 3 times as heavier parcel.<br />
 <br />
Our Terms and Conditions (which you explicitly accepted by placing this order) clearly state:<br />
The Twister Group reserves the right to supply less than the quantity of any item ordered.<br />
If you are accusing us in committing &ldquo;bait and switch&rdquo; by INTENTIONALLY misrepresenting the product, first accepting the policy and then denying such acceptance may be constituted as fraud.<br />
 <br />
Sincerely,<br />
The Twister Group</p></blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, don't do business with this guys.  None of the receipts I (including the one I printed from their site) state anything about changing the order after the fact.  In fact, it explicitly states "Group my items into as few shipments as possible" on the order confirmation page from their website that I printed to a PDF.</p>

<p>The second question was the one I've been waiting for someone to ask.  I would have loaded it even more:</p>

<blockquote><p>Senator, you stated in the debates last week that it would be a horrible idea to, and excuse me if I don't get the quote exactly right, "[hand] health care over to the government," yet for the majority of your adult life you have had government administered health care.  Have you had any problems with the government administered health care coverage that you have had for the better part of the last 50 years?</p></blockquote>

<p>Where's that question?  If government run health care is such a bad idea and would lower the quality of medical care that we receive, he should have been keeping his own private health care to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medigap/default.asp">fill in the gaps</a> that he's helped create.</p>

        <title>Ning Jobs: We're hiring!</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/">follow me</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, you know I've recently <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/statuses/855891689">gone to work</a> for <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>.  Been living under a rock and don't know what Ning is?  It's a platform that lets you build your own social network.  Best of all, if ya don't like the way something is implemented, you can get access to the source and change it around yourself.</p>

<p>The team of people working on Ning is amazing.  The number of new people since I stated a few weeks ago is crazy.  We're growing by leaps in bounds, but there a few positions that are close to my heart... if only because it helps spread the load of work that I'm responsible for! :-)</p>

<p>The team I'm on, Application Development (AppDev), needs more of us.  We're responsible for building the PHP and Javascript that the user interacts with when they're on the network.  When you create your own social network, you're on the code we write.  The same code that you <a href="http://help.ning.com/cgi-bin/ning.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2999">can get access to</a> if you want.  PHP and Javascript a great, but raw programming talent and a willingness to learn the languages are even more important.</p>

<p>We're also in need of a top notch Flash dev or two to join our team as well.  There are a few of us who can muddle our way through Flash apps and make things work, but having someone who <em>really</em> groks it would be a huge bonus.</p>

<p>If you're a top notch PHP or Flash guy and are interested in working on something big and exciting, Ning's got a place for you.  Telecommuting is definitely an option - I think about half of our AppDev team is remote now stretching from London to Melborne to Canada to NYC and (now!) Kansas.  Shoot me an email with your resume if you're interested.  Seeing as how my name is <em>travis</em> and the domain name is <em>ning.com</em>, an enterprising person should be able to figure it out: ;-)</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: I've closed the comments on this post.  We're only looking for people with very specific programming skills, so even though this shows up high on Google search results, it's not a general purpose job listing.  Might I suggest checking out <a href="http://monster.com">Monster</a> or <a href="http://hotjobs.com/">HotJobs</a>.</p>

        <title>Lessig on McCain on Tech: A must watch</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine having a phone service that only called other members.  Like Verizon's <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/innetwork.jsp">IN network</a>, except you can't get <em>out</em> of the network.  That's what some of the companies that provide the bandwidth behind the Internet would like to see the Internet become.  A place where they control who sees what.</p>

<blockquote><p>Want to go to Yahoo?  That's only $5 a month.  Google?  Well, that's $25 a month.  Oh, what's that?  You want to go to the sites you find on Google?  Well, that's an extra $75.  Oh, and here's our email client for you to check your email.  No, you can't use your own client...</p></blockquote>

<p>That's the kind of sales pitch you could get when signing up for Internet service in the future if "net-neutrality" is not defended.  It's an Internet that resembles AOL in the early 90s.  <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/cbcd3a48-4b0e-4864-8be1-d04561c132ea.htm">John McCain doesn't believe in net-neutrality</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When Regulation Is Warranted, John McCain Acts. John McCain does not believe in prescriptive regulation like &laquo;net-neutrality&raquo;...</p></blockquote>

<p>That's taken directly from his <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/cbcd3a48-4b0e-4864-8be1-d04561c132ea.htm">Technology Policies</a>.  Feel free to verify for yourself.</p>

<p>I could go on, but <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> (who's site happens to be down right now) did an <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/08/me_on_mccain_on_technology.html">excellent video</a> reviewing McCain's technology platform, so I'll let him do the speaking.</p>

This isn't yet another post on the <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org/news/10789">long overdue death of PHP4</a>, nor does it have anything to do with Olympics (which I'm <a href="http://digg.com/pets_animals/Olympics_clean_up_Chinese_style_Bejing_Cat_Death_Camps">boycotting</a>), nor does it have to do with today being three of the lazy infinity symbols side-by-side.</p>

<p>Today happens to be the day I'm getting married to <a href="http://twitter.com/MeganHoover">Megan</a>.  Should have already happened by the time this post becomes public.  Meg and I have been together for almost two years now.  Neither of us believe a piece of paper is the ultimate declaration of our love; we've been in a committed relationship with the intent of sticking together for quite some time now.</p>

<p>But...  every now and then it's nice to have those little things.  The introductions as "my husband" or "my wife", the ring, the tattoo (a story for another post).  So, today we're making a public declaration of our love for each other and our plans to see where this journey takes us.  Wish us luck... we'll need it! :-)</p>

        <title>My iPhone 3G Story</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/07/29/my-iphone-3g-story/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/07/29/my-iphone-3g-story</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As most of you who follow <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">me on Twitter</a> know, I've been trying to get an iPhone.  Not so hard that I've been camping out, but I've made a couple of unsuccessful trips to the Apple stores in the KC area.  Yesterday - my first full day in Cali - I managed to snag a white 16G and also managed to be one of the few people who's purchased an iPhone without waiting in line.</p>

<p>Around 7 last night me and a few of my <a href="http://ning.com">new coworkers</a> headed over to the Apple store that's a few blocks away.  I asked about getting a white iPhone and was told they were out for the day.  I got the low down on the process for getting one.  They passed out tickets based on how many phones they had in stock starting at 8 AM.</p>

<p>Once I knew the rules of the game, seemed simple enough to get one.  I'd just walk over one morning this week, spend 20 or 30 minutes waiting in line, then come in to the office.  We wondered around the store for a few minutes looking for a headset that the $200 cost scared her away from and then the girl from the front rushes up to me.</p>

<p>"Which iPhone did you want again?"</p>

<p>"The white one..."</p>

<p>"Ok, hold on."</p>

<p>She heads back up to the front, starts talking to one of the other "geniuses", then starts walking to the back.  "Today's your lucky day," she said as she walked past.  About 15 minutes later I was making my first call on my shiny new iPhone. :-)</p>

        <title>The Internet is an Orgy</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/07/20/the-internet-is-an-orgy/"/>
        <updated>2008-07-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/07/20/the-internet-is-an-orgy</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/19/terry_chay_isn_t_into_orgies">I mis-titled</a> <a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/">Terry Chay's</a> talk, I've been thinking of putting together a presentation called <em>The Internet is an Orgy</em>.  Just like a real orgy, it can be a lot of fun but it just takes one person to screw everyone.</p>

<p>That point has been getting proven today.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">Amazon's S3</a> service is experiencing it's second outage of the year.  According to <a href="http://status.aws.amazon.com/">Amazon's status site</a>, they're been down for roughly 6 hours right now.  Sites like <a href="http://smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> are completely down as they rely 100% on S3 to serve photos from.  Avatars on Twitter are broken because Twitter uses S3 to offload that content.</p>

<p>And the poor people using EC2.  EC2 isn't directly effected, but you have to have access to S3 in order to bring up another server.  This is six hours that you've had to make due with just the servers you have running right now.  All of that "elasticity" is just that - a marketing word in air quotes if you can't bring more servers online.</p>

<p>Don't think you're immune to this type of problem just because you're a consumer.  Case in point, if <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com">Ma.gnolia</a> goes down I loose access to all of my bookmarks and the ability to store anything else.  I <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/tswicegood/">bookmark</a> a lot when I'm wondering around the web.</p>

<p>I've <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/17/twitterific_distributed_versus_centraliz">blogged about distributed systems</a> before though.  Whenever I see a central point of failure, I cringe, but we move more and more the way of the centralized which I feel is against the very grain of the internet.</p>

<p>There are notable exceptions.  <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, my current favorite language, is designed to be distributed across machines with little more than a network connection and not fail if that connection disappears.  <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> enables distributed version control and is being used as a distributed data store for everything from open source projects to distributed ticket tracking systems. </p>

<p>I'm sure if I looked, I could probably find a few more examples.  This isn't meant to be a riff on centralized services like Amazon's S3 or EC2.  They are great and can be very valuable to scale out quickly, especially when you're just starting out.  There is the proverbial "but", however.  Don't think they won't go down just like any other service  Treat them just like any other cluster.  If you can't afford downtime, have a backup plan.</p>

        <title>When being an engineer isn't helpful: Kansas Motorcycle Test</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/06/12/when-being-an-engineer-isn-t-helpful-kan/"/>
        <updated>2008-06-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/06/12/when-being-an-engineer-isn-t-helpful-kan</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I think most of you know, I picked up a <a href="http://www.piaggiousa.com/pScooters/FLY150.cfm">Piaggio Fly 150</a>.  I need to get my motorcycle learner's permit and/or my license.  There's an on-road motorcycle course that's being offered here in town that I'm considering taking that waves the need to take the motorcycle skills test - haven't decided on that yet.</p>

<p>I've taken the written test&mdash;the only part that is required for the permit&mdash;twice.  And failed <strong>both</strong> times.  You can miss 5.  The first was 6, the second was 7.  They're both BS, though I would have been sort of surprised had I passed it on the first try.  I hadn't even opened the "manual" once.</p>

<p>So what questions have I missed.  Here's the first one: You following a car and the car following you is crowding you... what do you do?</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha"><li>Slow down</li>
<li>Speed up</li>
<li>Pass the car in front of you</li>
<li>Make rude gestures at the driver behind you while swerving from side to try to force them off of the road</li></ol>

<p>Ok&mdash;so the last one I made up, but it was something as obviously wrong as that.  So, what would you do?  I chose "Pass the car in front of you".  You're following another car, so you're at a safe distance, right?  Closing that gap means you are then being unsafe.  Slowing down is passive aggressive and you've got an ass driving behind you since he's tailgating so there's no telling how he'll react.  That leaves passing the car in front of you.</p>

<p>Nope.  According to the great state of Kansas, you're supposed to speed up.  Ok... no problem.  In all fairness I hadn't looked at the driver's manual so I wasn't expecting to pass it.  I figured I would flip through the book then take it again.  I took it again yesterday.  This time the score was worst, but I'm almost ready to say screw it on principle because of the two that I missed that threw me over the limit.</p>

<p>So here's the two questions I missed:</p>

<p>What is the best way to be seen at night?</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha"><li>Wear a retroreflective vest</li>
<li>Wear fluorescent clothing</li>
<li>Wear a white helmet with an yellow star</li>
<li>Wear a cape made of the stars and bars and have your radio playing Sweet Home Alabama at at least 100 decimals</li></ol>

<p>Yeah - we do things a little different in Kansas. ;-)  If you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Kansas">know anything about the history</a> of the state, you mark the last one off.  Though it might get you some attention, we're a free state.  And well, the helmet with a star is just silly.</p>

<p>So you can obviously narrow it down to the first two.  I had never heard of "retroreflective" until I saw it on this test.  I assumed it was a made up word and went with fluorescent.  Should have known better just from the "reflective", but I overanalyzed it and went with B.  Tonight I checked <a href="http://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/forms/mchdbk.pdf">the handbook</a>.  The phrase "retroreflective" doesn't appear at all!  Reflective yes, the five letters that make up "retro" in that order do not.  Period.  The question is bogus.</p>

<p>The next question I missed that I take issue with is thus:</p>

<p>What happens when your rear tire goes flat?</p>

<p>Before I so you the answers, remember that I'm a programmer.  My title is "Staff Engineer".  I approach things in a very (non-?)practical manner.  I don't look for what happens in practice, but what <em>should</em> happen.  Now, here's the answers.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha"><li>You will loose control</li>
<li>You will loose power to the rear wheel</li>
<li>Martians will invade your head</li>
<li>The rear of the bike will start to wobble uncontrollably</li></ol>

<p>Here's how that process goes in my mind.  Martians aren't interested in my brain 'cause I have a flat tire, that's off.  You don't automatically loose control, so that's off.  Loose power, or start to wobble?  Well, if you deflate a tire while putting uniform pressure on it, it will just deflate down to the rim.  Though if you deflate it, you loose traction which causes you to loose power&mdash;at least until you strip the wheel down to the rim and start riding on the rim.</p>

<p>Back and forth it goes.  I finally go with loose power based solely on the engineer in me.  Just because you loose air pressure does not mean the wheel wobbles.  I could set this experiment up in a lab and prove it.  Provide a slight deviation in how pressure is applied, then it wobbles.  Yes, I give you that, but the question doesn't mention that your passenger is turning their head so they can pick their nose.  There is <em>no</em> qualifications, so I am left to assume they want the proper answer.  You loose traction due to the deflation which causes you to loose power&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;to the rear wheel.</p>

<p>Grr!</p>

This week is pretty routine for me on the work front, so I think I can get away with it.</p>

<p>I have a simple reason for this experiment: curiosity.  I can think of all sorts of things I would like to be able to do if time weren't an issue, and picking up an extra 40 hours week seems like a good trade off.  In the end, I might not be able to keep it up just because of social strain it creates.  Since I don't have an office to go in to or very many particular schedules to worry about keeping, it seems like I should be able to handle the social part of it though.</p>

<p>I'll be sure to blog about anything interesting I discover, and of course I'll be <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">twittering</a> about it.  Now, maybe I can start making a dent in the ever-growing todo list that I have.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So this is the second day in a row that I've explicitly taken 10 minutes to write out a to do list for the day.  10 minutes is the max.  If I make it that long and am still writing things out, tough.  On today's list was write a blog post which was positioned after responding to a bunch of emails.  Responded to those messages, now time for the blog post.</p>

<p>First off, if you're wanting to keep tabs on me, my <a href="http://friendfeed.com/tswicegood">FriendFeed</a> is about the best way to do it.  I've almost created an app to do exactly what FriendFeed does.  I resisted joining FF when I first saw it because I wanted to do it myself.  Pragmatism finally won out though and I just signed up.</p>

<p><a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php|tek</a> was a blast.  All of the presentations I attended were interesting, though sadly there was no PHPT presentations *cough* *cough*... ;-)  Next time I guess.  The other presentations that were missing were talks on distributed data.  Everyone's talking about federated data being the only way to scale to the size of Tagged or Facebook or Digg, but no one was talking about how to do that practically.  I may take up the torch and see what I can put together on the topic if someone else doesn't do it first.</p>

<p>One thing that the conference did help with was my view of the state of PHP.  If one thing is going to save PHP from becoming the next Java (i.e., the language you make your living in but not the one you play with), it's the community.  There's lots of cool projects in the works, and lots of great people working on them.</p>

<p>I announced that I am running for the <a href="http://pear.php.net/group/">PEAR Group</a> to help shepherd the userland side of the community.  This next year I hope to get PEAR2 off of the ground and start getting greater community and business involvement in PEAR.  PEAR has some legacy cruft in the way it names packages and such that really make it hard to integrate PEAR1 code into an existing project.  Hopefully we can make PEAR2 easier to embed.</p>

<p>I plan on trying to get some sort of regular updates back on the blog.  In the meantime, <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">my twitter</a> account is updated pretty regularly.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, I know... it's been a long time.  Life's been busy.  Between work, PHPT, the book, and my new scooter there's been little time for little else.  I've really got to take <a href="http://thenazg.blogspot.com/search/label/polyphasic">Chuck's lead</a> and give <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/05/10/can-someone-survive-on-2-hours-of-sleep-">polyphasic sleeping</a> a try.  Until then, I'll have to get by just making the occasional updates.</p>

<p>I've finished some last minute errand running before heading to <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php|tek</a>.  Of course, I'll be <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">twittering</a> (if they can stabilize it - been horrible today).  Along with everyone else, I'll be tagging it with <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/phptek/">#phptek</a>.  </p>

<p>I'll also be doing some in person recruiting, so if you're interested in working at SugarCRM, look me up.  In particular, there's an <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/index.php?option=com_jobs&amp;task=show&amp;id=113">opening on my team</a> working on all of the public facing SugarCRM sites.</p>

        <title>Can someone survive on 2 hours of sleep per 24 hours?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/">these blog posts</a> you certainly can.  Imagine that.  Approximately 22 hours a day of conscious, usable time in every 24 hour period.  I say 24 hour period because apparently night and day become mixed up during this experiment.  <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=892542">One person</a> even went so far as to create new names for &quot;night days&quot;.  They ended up with a 14 day week.</p>

<p>This all sounds absurd.  One of those things that can't possibly work.  It's just counter to everything we've ever learned.  But then I think about the 6 small meals, or grazing throughout the day instead of large meals.  I played around with that for 3 or 4 months a handful of years ago and dropped down to the lowest weight I'd ever been, was full of energy, and generally pretty happy with life.  At the time it seemed like an anomaly to eat like that, but its becoming the accepted way &quot;diet&quot; now if you want to loose weight.  Could the same &quot;less, more often&quot; theory hold true for sleep too?  It seems just crazy enough that it might work.</p>

<p>I'm really curious to try this.  From what I've read you become useless&mdash;one person said zombie like&mdash;during the adaptation phrase which lasts from 1 - 2 weeks.  This means scheduling it when there's some downtime with nothing urgent on my plate.  This might mean waiting until the first draft of my <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">git book</a> is finished as I don't know how well I would be able to write while trying to adapt.</p>

<p>It also means getting Meg on board.  I believe her first reaction was "you're never trying anything like that... you get too cranky when you're tried."  That I am.  According to the blogs of people who have made it through the adaptation phase, you're never really tired in the normal sense though.  A break is always just a few hours away and you wake up feeling refreshed.</p>

<p>My mind just keeps coming back to all of the extra things I could do if I was only sleeping 14 - 16 hours a week.  Think about that for a second.  An extra 40 hours a week!  I could pay some attention to <a href="http://phpt.info">PHPT</a> and get it finished up.  I could knock out the rest of my book in two weeks.  I could get serious about going back to school for that pre-law bachelor's.  I would have the 30 - 60 minutes a day to devote to becoming fluent in another language.  Hell, if I picked the language based on when I was studying, I might even find a native speaker in another language to help me out with conversation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/">Steve Pavlina</a>, the author of the first linked post, kept it up for nearly 6 months before reverting back to nightly &quot;hibernating&quot;.  He felt fine and said he could have kept going, no problem.  The issue he ran into was being polyphasic&mdash;sleeping in small intervals through the day&mdash;in a monophasic world.  This seems to be the common thread in people who made the switch, then stopped.  The pressures of being at an office, or handling meetings, or being social during &quot;social times&quot; eventually got to be boring and/or not worth it.</p>

<p>I don't know if those would be an issue for me or not.  I have a pretty unique situation since I work remote and +2 hours from the majority of the rest of my company.  The only real schedule I have to sync with is Meg's schedule.  If I played it right, I could schedule a nap right after she goes in for work, mid way through her work day, and right before she gets off.  Then the rest of my naps would be during the time she's asleep anyhow so, assuming there were no ill-side effects, she would hardly notice that I was doing it.</p>

<p>I've started tagging some things that I've come across with <a href="http://del.icio.us/tswicegood/polyphasic">polyphasic</a> in my del.icio.us feed.  If you're interested in looking into this yourself, check them out.</p>

<p>This is one of those things that is just crazy enough I might have to try it.  If I do, I'll definitely blog about it.  With all of the extra time I might actually be able to keep the blog current again... :-)</p>

        <title>The meat cleaver that cuts: git rebase</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/04/17/the-meat-cleaver-that-cuts-git-rebase/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/04/17/the-meat-cleaver-that-cuts-git-rebase</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While I've been writing my Git book, I keep trying to pick up new tricks and figure out places to use them.  A came across <a href="http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive">a post on <code>git rebase --interactive</code></a> and knew I had to find an opportunity to play with this.  This morning, that opportunity came.</p>

<p>I've been working on some performance enhancement at work this week.  I use Git locally for all of my development, then push back to our central Subversion repo once my changes are done and approved for the main repository.  Timing for the changes I made earlier in the week was bad, so I was going to hang on to them for a week and push them when our engineering/QA department can absorb them more easily.</p>

<p>... the observant reader should be picking up on the past-tense here ...</p>

<p>So as part of my changes I created a Registry to share a single instance of an object around instead of going the Singleton route or putting the data in the global scope.  Pretty useful all round, but silly me didn't think to put that in a branch by itself so I could pull that change around as necessary.  No worries.</p>

<p><em>Light Bulb!</em>  "Ah ha!  I'll just switch into my branch and use <code>git rebase --interactive</code> to rewrite all of those commits and squash them together.  A quick <code>git cherry-pick</code> later and I'll have my Registry object in this new branch on some other functionality I'm working on."</p>

<p>If you've ever used <code>git rebase</code> you can probably see where this is going.  If you haven't, it's probably one of the more dangerous commands&mdash;if not the <em>most</em>&mdash;in Git.  It will literally let you reshape the history of the repository.  Running with scissors is child's play.  No, <code>rebase</code> can really screw you over.  Imagine riding a unicycle while juggling four meat cleavers and you'll have the idea.  Really, and I mean <em>really</em> impressive to watch, but one false move and you're screwed.</p>

<p>So back to my experience.  I proceeded to weed through the 80 or so commits from Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning and pull out everything that didn't relate to the code I wanted.  "Git will just ignore those" I naively thought.  I got it down to the 8 or so commits that had to do with my registry object and its tests and squashed them all into one commit.  I knew I was rewriting the history, but it never occurred to me that I was <em>rewriting</em> history.  I let <code>rebase</code> do its thing, then <code>cherry-pick</code>'d my newly created revision and was off.</p>

<p>Until this afternoon.  Rumor of my changes had made it around the office and someone else wanted to see them.  Since I only track our trunk and not all of our branches and I'm the only there using Git, the easiest solution was to just create a patch to send to him.  Simple enough.  Use <code>git merge --squash</code> and <code>git diff --no-prefix --cached</code> and I'd have a patch he could apply directly to his copy and we're set.</p>

<p>Needless to say, when I started reviewing the patch, I notice there was a lot missing. :-(</p>

<p>Lesson learned.  Don't play with live data when trying new stuff out.  When you miss a bean bag while you're juggling, you don't loose your toe...</p>

        <title>An Alternative to Zend?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can't believe I haven't seen this on <a href="http://planet-php.org/">planet-php</a>, but um... did everyone miss that <a href="http://www.projectzero.org/blog/index.php/2008/03/29/sugarcrm-running-on-project-zero/">Project Zero</a> is now running SugarCRM?</p>

<div class="videoblock"><object data="http://www.youtube.com/v/deAUxj8tSaI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/deAUxj8tSaI"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param></object></div>

<p>Am I the only one that's thinking a non-Zend Engine PHP might be kind of cool?  Maybe I'm biased since I use a lot of <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">Jython</a> in my day job scripting <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">The Grinder</a>, but hooking a dynamic language into the JVM is pretty cool.  Imagine not having to use tools like memcached 'cause all you need for a cache that's not mission critical is to instantiate a HashTable object.</p>

<p>I definitely hope IBM has plans beyond the commercial WebSphere sMash.  More interpreters is definitely a good thing.  Hopefully some others will take the cue and get PHP on the DLR (I'm looking at you <a href="http://elizabethmariesmith.com/">Liz</a>).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Either I'm making up for time I spent slacking, or I just took 4 years off of my life today.  Today I managed to:</p>

<ul><li>Have my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/git+book;">git book</a> from Pragmatic Bookshelf announced: <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit">Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</a> - It'll be on a shelf near you this fall and in PDF form before then.</li>
<li>I filed my taxes (not completely today - I'd already done then, just hadn't submitted them yet)</li>
<li>Proved conclusively that an installation stack wasn't stable for production (which is always fun when it's a random failure and you're having to play by the Law of Large Numbers)</li>
<li>Proved conclusively that another stack was stable</li>
<li>Should be able to prove or disprove a third stack configuration by the end of the night</li>
<li>Got <a href="http://phpt.info">PHPT</a> setup for inclusion into PHP as a replacement for the run-tests.php code which means it'll be distributed as part of the core PHP product</li>
<li>Got PHPT onto the Google Summer of Code project list for the upcoming summer (as part of it becoming part of php-src)</li>
<li>Fleshed out a killer business idea with a buddy of mine</li>
<li>Wrote what I think was a pretty good <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/04/09/the-future-of-relational-database-manage">article on relational databases</a></li>

        <title>The Future of Relational Database Management Systems</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/04/09/the-future-of-relational-database-manage/"/>
        <updated>2008-04-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/04/09/the-future-of-relational-database-manage</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's been a lot of buzz around cloud computing with Google's new <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> environment.  I'm not going to discuss the merits or issues with their new product and instead focus on the fact that they're giving developers access to the BigTable via its <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/datastore/">DataStore</a>.</p>

<p>This is the second major player to release access to an internal storage system that's document based, Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342335011&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">SimpleDB</a> being the other.  In the open-source space we have <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchDB</a> which is a distributed database that's completely document based.  I see a definite trend from creating databases with relationships to store everything in one big blob.</p>

<p>And this makes sense.  There are three motivators for normalized databases: reducing storage space, reducing processing required to find multiple instances of data, reducing number of places to update when something changes.  The first two are hardware related.  Computers and disks are ridiculously fast and cheap right now.  For less than $10k you can have a machine that can outpace a half million dollar machine from less than a decade ago.</p>

<p>That leaves having to update multiple places when you change data.  This is a technology problem and one that a lot of developers will recognize.  It looks eerily similar to what we've been doing with caches for a long time.  We grab the data, cache it the way we want, then retrieve that and ignore the shiny <abbr title="Relational DataBase Management System">RDBMS</abbr> that we have.</p>

<p>The problem with this is the same one you face with updating data in a de-normalized database.  The default way is to just timeout and grab data after its old enough that we consider it stale.  It's rudimentary, but works.  The next step is having your data layer smart enough to expire the cache itself when it changes.  Taking that further you end up with code that expires and primes the cache whenever there's an update.</p>

<p>Any route you take with caching, you end up with two data layers, the raw, relational database and the cached views of it.  So it seems that document databases are the next logical step.  Instead of creating this layer on top of you data to cache it, just store it as blob of data.</p>

<p>The one thing I haven't seen yet with these document-based systems is some sort of trigger mechanism in place, though, to make changes in one place ripple through the system.  That can exist at the database level or the <abbr title="object relational mapping">ORM</abbr> level.  It just has to be transparent to the developer.</p>

<p>Another interesting approach is what MySQL is planning for MySQL 6.  They'll have communication with memcached from within MySQL via a user-defined function (UDF).  There's already <a href="http://forge.mysql.com/projects/project.php?id=250">a project</a> on <a href="http://forge.mysql.com/">forge.mysql.com</a> that brings this functionality, but its still in alpha.  Something like this coupled with the use of <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/triggers.html">triggers</a> could address these issues completely by making the MySQL server simply a data storage and backup mechanism that you only touch during development.</p>

        <title>PHP's Problem</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/04/06/php-s-problem/"/>
        <updated>2008-04-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/04/06/php-s-problem</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How's that for a loaded title? ;-)  First off, let me state that I am by no means a PHP hater.  I've actually made quite a good living off of it, and <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">unlike some people in other languages</a>, I've never ended up on the streets homeless cause of PHP (yet).</p>

<p>I made <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/statuses/782440878">a comment</a> on Twitter about <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/23-the-immediacy-of-php">DHH's PHP</a> post.</p>

<blockquote><p>@chartjes that's sort of a backhanded comment, but it's dead on... PHP is ok until you start getting big, then it generally gets ugly</p></blockquote>

<p>He took that as a bash and decided to challenge me to a dual.  We nominated seconds, planned to cross the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr-Hamilton_duel">river into New Jersey</a>, then realized that Twitter without loaded pistols would probably be a much better solution.  And that's how the world's first <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/twebate/">twebate</a> was born.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/statuses/782859579">final tweet</a> on the debate I think sums up my view of PHP right now:</p>

<blockquote><p>[PHP]'s like that super smart slacker we all knew in HS. If it would just apply itself, it could be really great.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what it needs to do to "apply itself" as a language.  It could start by realizing "because we've always done it that way" isn't a good reason not to change broken behavior.  That's what compatibility modes are for.  It could also look to Python to see how everything as an object can be liberating unlike Java where it can hinder you.  It could realize that extensions are the next obvious step for anyone trying to make PHP hum and make the command to load a function/module&mdash;whether it's parsed or compiled&mdash;the same.</p>

<p>Every time I see a <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code>, have to look up to see whether the string function I'm using has an underscore or not between <code>str</code> and what it does, or have to read a manual entry to figure out if my array function modifies the array I pass it or returns a new one I sigh and can't help but be reminded by that anti-social kid in the back of the class, drawing furiously in his notebook.  He was a genius, he just needed some encouragement and the guts to grow up.</p>

<p>I've heard rumors that some of the bars are not going to be serving bottles of beer next weekend to keep the amount of sprayed beer to a minimum.   Unfortunately I wasn't partaking in the partying.  Next week though.  By then this cold should have run its course and I'll participate in the mob-making... :-)</p>

        <title>Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/03/23/pragmatic-version-control-using-git/"/>
        <updated>2008-03-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/03/23/pragmatic-version-control-using-git</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you follow <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">my tweets</a>, you'll have <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/statuses/774574296">seen</a> that I'm writing <i>Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</i>.  Needless to say, I'm pretty excited.  Of all of the publishers to write for, the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">accidental ones</a> have always been high on my list since the quality of their books is so universally high.</p>

<p>I've been wanting to write a book for awhile now, I just could never figure out what on.  Some time last year I decided that I wouldn't push it until some topic felt right.  This past winter as I learned Git it started to feel right.  Before I committed to a book, I decided to write an article (which should appear in over the summer in <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|architect</a>).  When I finished the article I realized I had barely scratched the surface and that it would take a full book to do the topic justice.  And now a few weeks after my initial pitch to the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a>, I'm set to start.</p>

<p>The market for this book is wide open right now.  There is nothing available in print form on Git so the newbie is left to manpages and random blog posts that Google turns up.  You can find out how to do just about anything, and in the time-honored Perl tradition, you can find out 10 different ways to do most things.  For someone just interested in evaluating it, though, there isn't much out there.  Find answers to the questions  "what good is it?" (in a non fanboy way) and "how do I use it every day?" requires some digging.  By the time I get through with this book, I plan on having both of those questions, and a few more answered.</p>

<p>Since this is my first book, I'm sure there'll be blog posts aplenty about the process and such.  Right now I'm raring to go, using most of my free time to write.  We'll see if I still feel that way after the third rewrite of an intro paragraph to some odd ball chapter.  :-)  If you're interested in following this, I'll be tagging posts with <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/git+book;">git book</a> (<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/git+book;?tempskin=_atom">atom feed of git book posts</a>).  </p>

<p>Finally, if you're feeling generous with your links, I'd love the help getting the phrase "<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/git+book;">git book</a>" to the top of Google.  Only one post tagged and I'm already on the front page, but it never hurts to have a few inbound links too ;-)</p>

Ok, so we're not looking for all of that.  The drinking part is optional. ;-)</p>

<p>Seriously, we're looking for a top notch <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> <abbr title="database administrator">DBA</abbr> to add to the ranks.  Someone with experience in PHP too is great, but the database experience and a willingness to learn the other parts of the job are even more important.</p>

<p>If this fits you, shoot me an email at tswicegood [at] sugarcrm [dot] com with your resume or a great cover letter if you're <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/why-bother-havi.html">so good you don't need a resume</a>.  Even if this doesn't fit you, we're looking for lots of positions.  From VP's in Sales to Engineers and everything in between.  If you're looking for work and want to work for one of the coolest big small companies in PHP-land, just let me know.</p>

<p>Oh, and given <a href="http://blog.calevans.com/2008/03/17/telecommutings-time-has-come/">Cal's recent comments on telecommuting</a> I should touch on that here.  If you do your job, you can do it from a sailboat (as one of the guys in Professional Services often does) for all we care.  Translated: we're telecommute-friendly.</p>

        <title>Why choose Git?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/03/12/why-choose-git/"/>
        <updated>2008-03-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/03/12/why-choose-git</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been kicking around the idea of a book on <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>.  I think it's a great tool, but there's a lack of an accessible guide to get started with.  In any book on a new technology or tool, there's the initial sales pitch.  Why should you use this?  How is it better than what you're already doing?  Than its alternative?  I'm trying to answer those questions right now for myself.  It's only a few paragraphs of the entire book, but I think having the answers will help keep me on track for the rest of the book.  Here's what I have right now.</p>

<h3>Distributed</h3>

<p>One of the main reasons for using Git over the two traditional version control systems&mdash;<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a> or <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>&mdash;is its distributed architecture. Instead of having one central repository, or one central point of failure, each developer clones the entire repository. Changes can then be pushed back to a central source, or a completely different source.</p>

<p>In the workplace, this allows for multiple layers of code review before the code makes it into the main repository. Each developer would push their changes back to their team's repository, with the team captain pushing changes back to the main company repository after they've been reviewed and the unit tests are verified.</p>

<p>In the open-source community, distributed means that no one company or person controls the repository. Any developer could easily publish their changes with the exact same history up to their change. These changes could then be incorporated by developers that are still tracking the official repository, allowing them to try them out without leaving their version control software unused.</p>

<h3>Easy Branching and Merging</h3>

<p>Branching within Git is easy and without much overhead. Tracking multiple branches, merging changes from many branches in to one, tracking changes across multiple merges. All of these are considered esoteric in most version control systems, only for the most advanced user. While they still take some practice in Git, doing them is straight forward.</p>

<h3>Tags are Just Tags</h3>

<p>If you moved from CVS to Subversion, you were probably surprised the first time you realized you could change code that you "tagged". Git enforces the "gentleman's agreement" found in Subversion by not allowing anyone to write directly to a tag, treating it as just a named snapshot.</p>

<h3>Network Not Required</h3>

<p>It is easy to forget in the age of always-on broadband connections, but we don't always have a network connection. Since your working copy is your repository, you don't need access to a network connection to track changes. You can safely work on your code on your next plane trip, tracking your changes the entire time, then sync with your repository after you've landed.</p>

<h3>Can Communicate with Subversion</h3>

<p>In the centralized world of Version Control Systems (<abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>), Subversion has become the defacto standard for new servers. Having the ability to communicate with SVN means that your entire company does not have to switch to Git just to suit one team or one developer. They can maintain their copy of the repository along side the existing infrastructure and push and pull changes to Subversion seemlessly.</p>

<p>Anyone out there using Git have anything more to add?  What's the obvious thing I'm missing?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a growing person, we should go through paradigm shifts regularly.  We don't, but we should.  I just had one tonight.  My sister <abbr title="instant message">IM</abbr>'d this evening and I started to tell her about the new paint I've got up in the office along with the new drapes I hung today.  As I got ready to type, I thought, "man, if she only had video IM."  Then I thought again, "oh wait, <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live</a>!"  (yes, I do think in hyperlinks)</p>

<p>Through <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/tswicegood/">my channel</a>, I gave her a quick tour of the office with the new paint color and the drapes in pretty much real-time with <strike>no</strike>, little fuss.  I had an issue where their UI was telling me that I wasn't broadcasting but it actually was.  Not knowing when the cameras are rolling could lead to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVynnbx1Xsc">all kinds of snafus</a>.</p>

        <title>Cranky Ol' PHP'er Syndrome (COPS) Defined</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/03/04/cranky-ol-php-er-syndrome-cops-defined/"/>
        <updated>2008-03-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/03/04/cranky-ol-php-er-syndrome-cops-defined</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time for a little humor. :-)  I thought I was the only one, but apparently there are <a href="http://pookey.co.uk/blog/archives/43-phplondon08-the-crazy-guy-mail.html">more like me</a>.  As its not just me, I'm defining a new disease that is rare, but does effect some PHP programmers.  Cranky Ol' PHP'er Syndrome, or <abbr title="Cranky Ol' PHP'er Syndrome">COPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Symptoms include consistently throwing out all but fringe tools when you start a new project.  I consider <a href="http://phing.info">Phing</a>, <a href="http://simpletest.org">SimpleTest</a>, and <a href="http://phpt.info">PHPT</a> to be "<em>fringe</em>" because hardly anyone uses them within the community.  Generally, sufferers have been in the PHP community for awhile, but have ample exposure to other languages.  Exposure to the other languages seems to be a trigger for this disease, but its not yet known if it is the cause.</p>

<p>General symptoms include <a href="http://pookey.co.uk/blog/archives/43-phplondon08-the-crazy-guy-mail.html">heckling of "experts"</a> in public places; general dislike of any code written by "monkeys" (i.e., code not written by yourself or someone who shares your disease); or a lot of unfinished projects since every one you start requires you writing all of the tools around it from scratch.  </p>

<p>Two other common early warning signs are purchases of books or perusal of websites of other languages.  As stated above, exposure to other programming languages appears to be a trigger.  If you've been programming longer than PHP has been around, you may have be a carrier for COPS and not even realize it.  Avoiding use of languages used prior to starting PHP may be enough to manage your disease.  If you started programming with PHP, be careful when exposing yourself to new languages.  Exposure to 1.2 - 1.4 new languages per 12 month rolling period is generally acceptable, but exposure any higher than 1.5 new languages puts you at severe risk.  Exposure to other dynamic languages should be avoided at all costs as it leads to feature-lust, a retrovirus that has been linked to COPS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no known cure.  Sufferers of COPS have been known to start other projects to try to rid themselves of excessive crankiness.  Forking existing projects is generally not advised, as legacy code is a known contributor to COPS.  Unsubscribing from mailing lists has also been known to help.  For those, such as myself, who can't bring themselves to do that, liberal use of "mark all as read" has also helped in some studies.</p>

<p>In the some cases, using Java for extended periods (also known as Java-therapy) has helped, but in the most severe cases, using Java can cause even further COPS symptoms.  If you feel you are suffering from COPS, avoid Jython and JRuby at all costs, as exposure to them may make the symptoms worse.  </p>

<p>Avoid using fully integrated development environments as well, and revert to a plain text editor.  If this does not work, using command scripts such as echo, cat, and sed may be necessary to help reconnect you with your primal programmer.</p>

<p>In the most severe cases, using a red marker to desecrate books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDesign-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional%2Fdp%2F0201633612&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Design Patterns</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEnterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature%2Fdp%2F0321127420&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRefactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology%2Fdp%2F0201485672&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Refactoring</a> have helped.  (Note: please avoid libraries while undergoing this treatment)</p>

<p>This disease, though chronic, is not fatal.  Many have sought treatment, while some have embraced it as a new way of life.  A select few have gone so far as to join <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">religious sects</a> and try to convert fellow PHP programmers.  Others who have chosen not to seek treatment and instead taken up the roll of "fool on the hill", silently observing the community.</p>

        <title>An awesome user experience</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/27/an-awesome-user-experience/"/>
        <updated>2008-02-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/27/an-awesome-user-experience</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/02/10/unbeatable-price-guarantee-at-circuit-ci">complain</a> <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/02/21/maybe-i-m-just-a-movie-snob-jumper-mini-">too</a> <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/02/24/sometimes-the-road-calls">much</a>.  Just to remind myself that all is not bad with the world, I thought I'd share an awesome user experience I had today.</p>

<p>Today I had a dental appointment at a new (to me) <a href="http://www.lesmillerdds.com/">dentist</a>, <a href="http://www.lesmillerdds.com/aboutus.html#Les_Miller">Les Miller, DDS</a>.  I had already been there once before with Megan where they worked her in with just a few hours notice as a new patient for an emergency consult.  I was extremely impressed with their operation as an observer, but today I got to experience it from the end-user perspective.</p>

<p>I had some paperwork to fill out, so I showed up about 15 minutes early.  As soon as I walked through the door the x-ray tech greeted me and told me to come on back and we could get those started.  No looking at the clock and waiting until the last possible minute to help me.  When was the last time you got in <em>early</em> to see anyone in the medical industry?  Once we finished up the x-rays, the dental hygienist was ready and got me right in.  Turns out I've taken a little too long since the last time I was in, so she recommended a slightly different course of action than the standard cleaning to get my mouth from 95% back up to 100%.</p>

<p>Here's what was different from how it could have gone.  The dentist has you stuck, essentially.  At this point all the dental hygienist has to tell me is "we've got to do X" and most people&mdash;well, at least I'm going to go along.  She's the expert.  I'm coming to her for a service.  If she tells me we need to do something, well, we need to do.  Instead of taking that approach though, she walked me through the entire process, then went over the options right along with what she recommended.</p>

<p>She involved me in the process by engaging in a <a href="http://cluetrain.com/#95theses">conversation</a> rather than just telling me.  The flip side of this is now I bare some responsibility for my choice.  Since a conversation works two-ways, I've got to keep up my end to make sure we get to my desired outcome.</p>

<p>Those extra ten minutes invested today will pay off though.  They got an active participant which will help ensure a positive outcome and a walking, talking advertisement.  Because my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design"><abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr></a> was so good, I'll definitely be recommending them to anyone I know in the area who needs a dentist.  And here you though UX was all about software. :-)</p>

        <title>Sometimes the road calls</title>

        <updated>2008-02-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/24/sometimes-the-road-calls</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been having a hard time getting to sleep recently.  If I was a drunk, I'd be drinking myself into sleep, but I'm not.  I'm a reader, so I read myself into sleep.  When the words and lines cross and the same sentence seems new even though its the fifth time I've tried to read it, I put my book aside and succumb to sleep.  Restless, tortured sleep.</p>

<p>I exaggerate.  But then again, it is past midnight and my normal bout with a book didn't work.  I laid in bed for 15 minutes before finally switching the light back on and bringing up a book of sudoku.  A few puzzles later and I'm even more awake than I was when I started.  Normally the pattern and the numbers will lull me into a stupor, priming my mind for dreams where numbers overlay the world and navigating my dream world requires a pattern matching skill not unlike that necessary for <a href="http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/products/sudoku/solution_examples.htm#scanning">scanning</a> in sudoku.</p>

<p>I've been fighting it, but tonight I have no choice but to admit what's been keeping me awake.  A road has been calling me.  It's a desolate one, leading to a not-unfamiliar town in middle America.  I drove this road for the first time late one night some four or five months ago.  It was the first time I drove down this road, I wasn't sure were it would lead me.  A few hours down the road and I stopped.  Since then, it's been calling me and I've been ignoring it.</p>

<p>Every night it crosses my mind as I dive further and further into the next book, the next puzzle, the next level on a video game.  Its call started out gentle, but as I've ignored it, it has grown impatient.  As it has grown impatient, it has grown louder, until tonight I can't hardly close my eyes but I see the road markers lazy pass by as I drive down that road.  I can't hardly drift to sleep for the gentle thud as I hit the stutter bumps as the road reminds me that it is there.  Waiting, asking to be driven.  Still gently, but persistently.</p>

<p>I've no other choice but to give in.  I've got to follow this road and see where it winds up.  Where it goes, I'm not sure yet.  I know this much: it takes me to a week in a life that I've yet to live.  It takes me to some discovery.  Profound or mundane?  I've yet to realize it.  This road won't leave me alone until I explore it and see where it leads to.</p>

<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a story to write.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thud, thud, thud.</p></blockquote>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://c7y-bb.phparchitect.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1108">contest</a> could be fun.  It appears that <a href="http://blog.preinheimer.com/">Paul "PHP" Reinheimer</a> is semi-disposed of so we won't have the full settings of PHP yet, but depending on what's turned on, we could get some very interesting results.</p>

<p>I threw together a couple of variations of a solutions this afternoon and testing them out with <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/index.php?package=Domain51_MicroBench">Domain51_MicroBench</a>.  Seems <code>foreach</code> has had some tuning of how it handles temporary variables since the last time I benchmarked it.  I also found out how little PHP cares about whitespace.  I've got my current solution down to 130 bytes, with another 3 I could drop if they allow short tags.  </p>

<p>Of course, I could cut that by quite a few more depending on the config ;-)</p>

        <title>Maybe I'm just a movie snob?  Jumper mini review</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Or maybe the movie was that bad.  Let's put it this way, 30 minutes in I was already checking the clock on my phone to see how much longer it was going to go on.  Seriously, it could have been so good.  A supernatural power.  A sinister organization that's hell bent on eradicating jumpers.  A hero, abandoned at a young age for his own safety (can we say Luke Skywalker?).  Oh, and there's the love of his life that he accidentally brought into this by his own stupidity that he now has to risk everything to save...</p>

<p>They set the movie up great at the start (minus the whole you're too stupid to put two and two together, so we'll do a voice over), but then it just got random.  The mother's disappeared, but they made sure to show you her picture before the teenage David takes off.  Note to self: Mom's coming back up...  Sure enough, here she is, and she's working for the bad guy but she gives him a head start.  So it's the classic redemption story.  I'm starting to hear a <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Vader's_armor#Breathing">labored breathing</a>... Is that haunts of Darth Vader as she redeems herself by making the ultimate sacrifice to save her son that she abandoned all those years ago?  Nope, just put in there as a ploy to setup the squeal at the end of the movie and as a convenient escape-enabler in the middle.  And what's the deal with the half-sister?  Is she a jumper and she just doesn't know it?</p>

<p>The special effects were cool.  The fight scene in the Colosseum had tinges of Neo on the roof top in the Matrix.  A few tweaks to the story line and it was an awesome movie.  Seriously, just tweaks.  They had all of the elements for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces">classic hero story</a>.  I guess the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/fullcredits#writers">writers</a> forgot the whole story part.</p>

<p>This is the first movie I've seen in a long time that I seriously felt like I wasted my money on.  And that's saying a lot since the tickets were free.  Reading through the first chapter of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dDGGBmOnlsAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;sig=A-pvlihXKfrBWOkNO4plgsFkCcI">book</a>, it looks like its a different story.  Not surprising, but ashamed Hollywood screws up another good story.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh man... I'm spending too much time in front of a computer.  So I knew today was President's Day, but I had no idea we had the day off.  I felt bad for getting such a late start this morning, but was well on my way to making up.  Got some emails off, to which I hadn't heard responses, got some data generating for a large load test I'm working up, and then it dawned on me.  No one but the remote folks were online.  And they were mostly away.</p>

<p>A quick check of the holiday list, and <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">we</a> do observer President's Day.  So I think that means I just accrued another half day of <abbr title="paid time off">PTO</abbr>. ;-)</p>

        <title>Expertise Syndrome Defined</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/13/expertise-syndrome-defined/"/>
        <updated>2008-02-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/13/expertise-syndrome-defined</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm coining a new phrase.  <em>Expertise Syndrome</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>expertise syndrome (n): </p><ol><li>becoming so skilled in a given topic, methodology, etc., that you can't discuss it with someone who is lesser skilled than yourself as you leave out significant parts by deeming them "common knowledge".</li>
<li>when knowledge within a community becomes "common knowledge" and is no longer discussed at which point new comers often find it hard to find basic information.</li></ol></blockquote>

<p>The seeds of this started last summer when <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul M. Jones</a> posted <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/?p=250">TDD, Test-First, and Ravioli Code</a>.  Paul is a really smart guy, but somehow he missed (and he still does) the point of <abbr title="test driven development">TDD</abbr>.  The only explanation I can come up with for this is that we, the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7031626931">TDD community</a> inside PHP, haven't properly conveyed our message of peace, harmony, and code with fewer bugs and programmers with fewer white hairs since they we're validating our work as we go in the form of executable specifications.  </p>

<p>We had apparently left out a key part of our case: namely that unit tests provide us with a way to manage the inevitable change that comes with software by ensuring that the entire system is properly exercised in a repeatable way.  Write a test, make it pass, then move on to the next task.  Then, once you start to see how things interact, you start refactoring.  You already have your expected outcome being verified by the tests.  Now all that's left to do is incrementally add new tests to verify the new functionality you add in and refactor the existing code.  Your tests serve as the stutter bumps on the side of the highway, giving you an early warning by failing if things aren't going correctly.  On the flip side, they can also be used to track down all of the places in your code that are affected by the change you're making providing the true lazy man's methodology: "oh I'll just change my code for the better and my tests will tell me what I need to fix".</p>

<p>But I digress...  I ran into another case of my own expertise syndrome few weeks ago with a colleague of mine.  We've started a concerted effort at work to get unit tests implemented around our product and since I'm the resident TDD guru, I got tapped to give a presentation on unit testing.  I put together about an hours worth of slides on the basic concepts, determined not to do the standard 2 + 2 test case and show some "real-world" use cases mixed in with a few of the test cases that we already have in our test suite along side the basic syntax and theory someone would need to get started writing test cases.</p>

<p>I gave the presentation I would have loved to have been privy to some 4 or 5 years ago when I started down the TDD path.  These guys left the presentation having at least heard of "<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html">four phase tests</a>" and "<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Intent%20Revealing%20Name.html">intent revealing names</a>".  Based on the feedback I've received and the number of people who are now committing tests, I think it went over well enough and that everyone felt like it was a good use of their time.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the presentation, a new test was committed that broke another, unrelated test.  An undefined index error or something similar.  I started investigating and within just a few minutes found that one of the super-globals had been set explicitly to an array in the new test case's <code>setup()</code> method.  The new value didn't contain the value that should always be there, so the next test case that relied on it failed.  Classic case of an <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Erratic%20Test.html#Interacting%20Tests">interacting test</a> and something I just took for granted and a concept I completely ignored in my presentation.</p>

<p>I found myself doing this again a few months ago when I was working on an article for <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|architect</a> on <a href="http://phpt.info">PHPT</a>.  I was 3/4<sup>th</sup> of the way through the article before I realized that I had never explained how to actually run the software.  Seriously.  I had covered installing it, both from its <a href="http://channel.phpt.info">channel</a> and SVN, how to write the tests, and had started writing how to extend the testing framework before it dawned on me that I'd missed the most crucial part: how to run it.</p>

<p>I experienced this syndrome from the opposite side when I made the switch to <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>.  There's tons of information, but most people inside that community have apparently been using it long enough that they didn't realize that saying "type <code>git init</code>" wasn't enough to convey that doing so created the repository and stored it in the ".git" directory and that you didn't have to checkout a copy of your repository.  I spent an afternoon trying to figure it out.  I consider myself a pretty intelligent guy, so heaven help the guy who's only exposure to version control thus far has been <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>.</p>

<p>Today I had even further confirmation that this is a real syndrome that we, both individually and collectively contribute to it.  I received a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/02/07/notes-from-paul-greenberg-s-keynote-suga#c8317">message</a> from <a href="http://www.the56group.typepad.com/">Paul Greenberg</a> in response to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/02/07/notes-from-paul-greenberg-s-keynote-suga">notes on his keynote</a> at SugarCon.  He specifically addressed my criticism that his slides had too much information on them.  He said it I might be right, but that he wanted to include it so he could provide all of the information and context whenever he sent his slides to someone.  Fair enough, but I would have never thought to do this since I use <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> and it has the concept of a "handout" section that you can stuff in that narrative or contextual information that's normally in your presentation.  My guess&mdash;and I might be wrong&mdash;is that Paul's never heard of S5 and that the ability to provide contextual information along side the slides that is hidden unless you're "reading" the slides (either by printing or turning the slide show off) is something new to him.  And I'll bet this isn't the only tool that I take for granted that others might find useful, if only they knew it existed or how to use it.</p>

<h3>Battling this disease</h3>

<p>There isn't a cure, but I think its symptoms can be managed allowing its sufferers to effectively interact with the plebeians.  <em>... removing tongue from cheek ...</em>  As a programmer, one way to hone your "<em>novice thinking skills</em>" is to constantly add new languages to your repertoire.  There's no need to become an expert in them, but learn their methods for approaching problems.  Try to think in that language.  You'll be amazed at how the shift in paradigms will force you to rethink your assumptions.  I recently picked up <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> and the shift to functional from imperative programming was&mdash;no, still is disorienting. </p>

<p>Another suggestion is to explore new tools.  See if they fit with how you work by committing to using them for a week or two.  It doesn't matter what they are.  Could be a new version control system, <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDE</abbr>, or finally putting all of your tasks in some sort of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">task manager</a>.  The point is to try to mix it up and keep from getting into a rut.  Note that a rhythm and a rut are two completely different things.  The former is great and can make you much more productive, the latter will cause you to stagnate.</p>

<p>Constantly approaching something new with curiosity should help keep you in a novice mindset.  The next time I'm writing an article or preparing a presentation I'll make sure to keep "why?" close by.  Why is this the best practice?  Why should I use this pattern over that one?  You've gotta love those <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/why">three little letters</a>.</p>

        <title>"Unbeatable price guarantee" at Circuit City - yeah right...</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/10/unbeatable-price-guarantee-at-circuit-ci/"/>
        <updated>2008-02-10T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/10/unbeatable-price-guarantee-at-circuit-ci</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe it's cause I spent the past week at SugarCon and heard a lot of talk about "customer experience" and business, but right now I'm pissed.  Today is one of the few times I've let laziness get the better of me and referred to a manager in a colorful, albeit lazy, vernacular as I walked out of the store.  But let's back up to how this all began...</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.accordingtomegan.com/">Meg's</a> main computer has been an iBook that is nearing the terminal point in its life.  It's already had a motherboard replaced and now the touch-pad is on the fritz.  Throw in the power cord that only works if you rotate it once clockwise, twice counter-clockwise, and then jiggle and well, it's time for a new computer for her.  We've been talking of getting a desktop and I wouldn't mind having a slightly more powerful system for gaming, so I decided to pick up a run of the mill desktop.  </p>

<p>I've had a <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com">Circuit City</a> card for a few years now that I use when I need generic electronics as they almost always have some sort of special going&mdash;90-days no interest, no interest for 18 months, no interest until the 4<sup>th</sup> moon after the third year of life after today, etc., etc.  Last week before I left, I picked up a reasonably good deal on a Compaq computer and a new monitor.  I ordered it online Saturday night before I left because I knew if they had a better deal the next day I could just use their "<em><a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/lookLearn.do?cat=-13318&amp;edOid=105471">unbeatable price guarantee</a></em>".  In case you're not familiar:</p>

<blockquote><p>Find a lower advertised price from another local store with the same item in stock, and we'll gladly beat their price by 10% of the difference. <em>Plus, if you see a lower advertised price within 30 days of your purchase with us, we'll refund 100% of the difference.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.  Low and behold, Sunday morning they're advertising the same bundle I got for $100 less, plus a printer.  I don't need another printer, but to save a hundred bucks and have a spare one laying around, sure, I'll take it.  The only problem is the store opens at 10 and I need to be at the airport 20 minutes away from it by 10:40 to get checked in and make my flight.  I'm not worried as I've never had any issues with customer service at Circuit City, I'll just pick it up and wait until I get back in town before I get the new one, take my receipts in, then let them work their magic.</p>

<p>Well, today I tried that.  Now, back to where this started.  Here's how the conversation went:</p>

<ul><li>Customer Service Rep: What can I do for you?</li>
<li>Me: I bought a computer a week and a half ago and this past week you had a special on it but I was out of town until yesterday afternoon.  I wanted to get a refund for the difference.</li>
<li>CSR: I can't.  We don't do price matches on specials that are no longer valid.</li>
<li>Me: I have the sales sheet right here and was out of town and unable to get back in here until today.</li>
<li>CSR: Well, I sorry, but I can't do it.</li></ul>

<p>You have to realize that the "sorry" here is as saturated with the poison of not giving a damn about the person they're talking to or their problems as is possible by someone who finds themselves behind a customer service counter in JoCo at 11:30 on a Sunday morning as is possible.</p>

<ul><li>Me: Ok, so you've got two choices then.  Refund me the $100's difference, or I'll just return the computer.</li>
<li>CSR: <i>Blank stare, then turns to the person who is apparently her supervisor</i> "Is there..." </li>
<li>CSR Supervisor: You'd have to run that by so and so. &mdash;apparently the store manage</li>
<li>CSR: <i>back to me</i>: Just a minute...</li></ul>

<p>At this point I'm slightly annoyed that I'm having to argue the case.  They don't advertise "run down with the ad as fast as you can and we'll get you hooked up".  No, they advertise "buy it now cause we'll take care of you if the price goes down".  A few minutes later after talking to someone in what I can only describe as a cross between a Cosby and a Mr. Roger's sweater, she comes back over and asks for my receipt.  No full explanation of what's happening, but takes my receipt, prints out another, compares a few things, then takes off to Mr. Cosby Rogers.</p>

<p>Another few minutes later, and she comes back.  Now she tells me what's up.  Apparently they're only going to credit me $60 for the monitor because there was a mail-in rebate that they won't credit retroactively.  I'm still a little annoyed but I'm not armed with a copy of their policy (which I would have been had I thought this was going to be a hassle) so I say ok.  I'll double check everything later and take this up with corporate.</p>

<p>While she is finishing everything up, the manager comes in to the service desk for something else and checks on this to make sure everything is going and literally takes my breath away.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dipshit of a Manager: So we're only going to refund the $60 on the monitor because it's not our policy to refund on sales that aren't still going on.  I'm doing it this one time as a courtesy, but if you <em>try</em> to do it again, I'm not going to ok it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine, but the fact that "<em>try</em>" is in that sentence at all is un-<strike>fucking</strike><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Boone">Booning</a>-believable (Pat Boone says in an interview in the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0486585/">Fuck</a> that he uses his last name as a swear word if he can't think of something else to say).  So apparently, trying to use Circuit City's own policy is trying to slip one past 'em.</p>

<ul><li>Me: You know, I've never had this issue before.  I've even had stores change prices when I ordered online and picked it up in the store because the store was selling at a lower price than they were online.</li>
<li><abbr title="Dipshit of a Manager">DoaM</abbr>: Yeah, but what was it?</li>
<li>Me: Fifty bucks or so on an iPod.</li>
<li><abbr title="Dipshit of a Manager">DoaM</abbr>: Yeah, they probably just let it slide since it wasn't that much.</li>
<li>Me: Silence...</li></ul>

<p>At this point, I can't believe what I'm hearing.  Store managers, actually, it was a CSR the last time that adjusted the price of her own free will without me even asking for it, have the power to decide when they enforce Circuit City's own policy.  Interesting.</p>

<p>So Circuit City struck out. Not to be one to only complain, here's how I would have handled this situation assuming I was a CSR dealing with me.</p>

<ul><li>Customer Service Rep: What can I do for you?</li>
<li>Me: I bought a computer a week and a half ago and this past week you had a special on it but I was out of town until yesterday afternoon.  I wanted to get a refund for the difference.</li>
<li>CSR: Hmm... We don't normally honor sales that are no longer on, but let me go check with my supervisor and see if there's anything we can do.</li></ul>

<p>Then disappear for a few minutes.  Head in to the break room, then text your boyfriend, gossip with whoever's on break, drink a soda.  I don't care.  Appear to be trying to make my life better, then come back and tell me you can't.</p>

<ul><li>CSR: I'm sorry, I can't.</li>
<li>Me: Ok, so you've got two choices then.  Refund me the $100's difference, or I'll just return the computer.</li>
<li>CSR: I tell you what.  Let me go take this to the store manager and make sure there's nothing we can do.</li></ul>

<p>Now you've got a live one, actually try to get something done.  At this point, the store manager should have come over and personally oversaw or done the refund himself.  You know money is being made on these at the price you sold it at 14 hours earlier, so you take advantage of that leeway you have under the auspices of "customer satisfaction".</p>

<p>Looking back at our exchange, the part that pisses me off the most isn't that I had to threaten the dump the computer back on them, it's that the manager came over and acted like such a prick.  The vindictive side of me wants to feel sorry for the guy.  Life's got to be rough if you're working the opening shift on a Sunday at a Circuit City in the middle of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=golden+ghetto+johnson+county">golden ghetto</a>, but still.  You've got an opportunity to make someone's day a bit better, make a customer happy, and make more money for your company in the long run.  Instead, you blew it.</p>

<p>I'm kind of snobbish when it comes to customer service, I'll acknowledge that.  I like to feel like I'm being taken care of.  Satisfaction is a perception.  If you had the $60 leeway, use it, but make me feel good about it and like you actually cared and were trying to help me out.  Don't come over and make some snide comment about how if I come back in again asking for you honor your own policy you won't.  I want to feel like when I walk in the store you're actually glad I chose you as the place to make my purchases.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://the56group.typepad.com/">His</a> presentation was good - he's an engaging speaker who's only fault is that he puts too much data on his slides which is just a preference thing with me.  I feel like I'm getting distracted when I read it.  At any rate, it's kind of weird seeing people in rapture of what he's talking about because I'm part of the generational shift in how things are done.  What he's talking about - organic user bases, everything as a social connection, etc., etc. - are just <em>what I do</em>.</p>

<p>He mentioned <a href="http://threadless.com/">Threadless.com</a> like it was this amazing thing and it's just natural for me to check it out if I'm looking for a cool shirt.  The fact that the designs are user contributed and voted on is a footnote for me, for him that's the ball game.  It's definitely interesting to see an "outsiders" perspective on the current state of the markets.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>parallels between Facebook as a social utility and electricity as a social utility.  Interesting idea...</li>
<li>"open source serves as the building blocks to the new social utilities"</li>
<li>"IT Decision Paths are Changing" - from the CIO who used to make choices at the top, to CTOs and developers who push technology, to consumers who demand certain technologies.</li>
<li>Customers don't like "don't worry, just buy everything from us", they want choice</li>
<li>The MySQL slide is titled "The Heart of the Web Economy"</li>
<li>OpenOffice.org gets a million downloads a week and has 100 million registered users</li>
<li>"if they're using our free solution, they're not using our competitors solutions"</li>
<li>Standard Chartered bank started passing out phones to build their banking institution in South Africa.  They viewed it as fighting poverty as one of the root causes of it is lack of access to information.  Interesting view.</li>
<li>The first question was about Microsoft and Yahoo!</li>
<li>"I think that could be seen as one company obsessing about their competition."</li>
<li>He's focusing on the fact that they don't compete with companies, they serve their customers.  Interesting way to look at it.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a bunch of the funnier remarks from the <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve Jobs</a>.</p>

<ul><li>3,000 customers, some of those even pay... some of those even pay on time.</li>
<li>'did you ever notice that guys who are in to Eastern religions are the biggest assholes?'</li>
<li>"I don't hate freedom, it's like hating freedom!"</li>
<li>"Freetards" </li>
<li>"If you the biggest thing in your life is that you can't hack your Tivo, you need to get more things in your life."</li>
<li>"we have crazy right-wing born again people running our country and the thing that gets people crazy is DRM in iTunes?"</li>
<li>"You don't to raise $10 or $20 million dollars to start a company.  It's really bad news for Sun..."</li>
<li>"They (SugarCRM) were so excited [about the MySQL Sun deal] that they could hardly contain themselves"</li>
<li><i>The End of Open-Source Culture</i> - talking about how open-source is mainstreamed now.  He ripped the title from the article <i>The End f Gay Culture</i> which talks about it mainstreaming.</li>
<li>He thinks John will have body guards by the end of next year...</li>
<li>"The Cheap Revolutions"</li>
<li>Oracle isn't distributing Linux because they're nice - it's cause I think they want to kill Red Hat.</li>
<li>on Oracle's Linux: "You've been screwing up my database for a dozen years, so here, let me bend over and you can shove your OS in too..."</li>
<li>"The Pyramids of Giza, the Great Wall of China, then Properitary Software."  </li>
<li>"We'll be wow, that really happy."</li>
<li>"Larry's accomplished everything in his life, except beat Wilt Chamberlin's record.  And I'm not talking about in basketball.  [laughter] Some of you got that, right?"</li>
<li>"He's closing in - thanks to Vi-agra"</li>
<li>"I think MS and Yahoo coming together is like a taking a hundred yard dash and tying to legs of the 2nd and 3rd place runner together and asking for a rematch"</li>
<li>"the new office is like the dashboard of the spaceshuttle"</li>
<li>"you have to have help desk and a suicide line"</li>
<li>"The problem with the Stalinites don't buy anything..."</li>
<li>They love petitions, but they don't buy anything.</li>
<li>The COO of Delta is the now head of Red Hat?  That's like flying Microsoft</li>
<li>I don't want to joke about Red Hat because I think they might buy you...</li>
<li>Red Hat is like the Bermuda Triangle, they buy companies and they're never heard of again.</li>
<li>Question: "You've made fun of everyone but SugarCRM.  What do you say about them when you're at other people's conferences?"</li>
<li>"It's hard to make fun of these guys when they're on the right side..."</li></ul>

<p>His presentation was suffixed by a "in the 8 point font, these views weren't necessarily the views of SugarCRM." :-)</p>

<li>3 to 160 people</li>
<li>"Cloud Computing" has been listed on a half dozen slides thus far...</li></ul>

<p>Martin used Google Earth to do a "tour" of how SugarCRM grew.  It's not cooperating too well though.  IT guy to the rescue.  We have a lot of deployments in Brazil.  "It's like watching bacteria" in describing how SugarCRM is spreading in Europe.  We've got a lot of coverage in Japan and China too, but the mainland in Europe is completely covered. </p>

        <title>Ken Brill's Mashing SugarCRM Presentation Notes</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/06/ken-brill-s-mashing-sugarcrm-presentatio/"/>
        <updated>2008-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/02/06/ken-brill-s-mashing-sugarcrm-presentatio</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ken is one of our open-source hires.  He contributed to our forums then came on board.</p>

<ul><li>He's a self-styled programming layman</li>
<li>What is Web 33 1/3? :-)</li>
<li>Some links to web APIs for mashups: <a href="http://www.webmashup.com">http://www.webmashup.com</a></li>
and <a href="http://techmagazine.ws /full-web-20-api-list">http://techmagazine.ws /full-web-20-api-list</a>.
<li>Ken is demonstrating Google docs inside of SugarCRM.  That's actually an awesome use of it.</li>
<li>One of his older hacks was using Y! getting local time based on where the client was.</li>
<li>Next up is bringing Google Gadgets to the SugarCRM Dashlets</li>
<li>Some of the more useful ones he mentioned are "Hotjobs so you can look for your new job while you screw around on your current one..."  "Britney Watch"</li>
<li>He's not a fan of Dr. Pepper Cherry Chocolate - "my god that's a horrible mashup"</li>
<li>"ModuleBuilder is the best thing that happened to Sugar in my opinion."</li>
<li>side note: Ken's St. Louis accent is coming through with his "alls I had to do" :-)</li>
<li>note to self: double check any syntax highlighting before giving a presentation.  Zend Studio's lime green highlight doesn't come through the screen that well.</li>
<li>note to self: Get Ken running APC or Zend Platform ;-)</li>
<li>His Google Doc presentation is pretty spiffy.  I was hoping for an embedded Google Doc inside SugarCRM, it currently just gives you a list view which is useful by itself, but if it was inside Sugar it would be even cooler.</li>
<li>He used the Zend Framework/Google Doc examples to actually interface with Google Docs.</li>
<li>Second up was a Google Gadget mashup.  It was extremely straight forward, just pull in the &lt;script&gt; value inside a set of {literal} tags in the Smarty template for a dashlet.  </li>
<li>note to SugarCon guys: The presentation could have been cool as a <abbr title="Bring Your Own Laptop">BYOL</abbr> presentation and actually created one or two mashups on the fly</li></ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I battled with my computer trying to get <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git's</a> manual to install.  Yes, I know they distribute the manual already packaged, but I have my git compiled from their repo, so why shouldn't my docs be in step?  I found a lot of info on <a href="http://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Installing_Git_1.5.2.3_on_Mac_OS_X_Tiger">this wiki</a> page that helped get me started in the right direction, but was still having issues.  Turns out, the latest version of <a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/xmlto/">xmlto</a> uses a <code>cp -a</code> command which is a no-go on OSX.</p>

<p>The fix is simple enough, on line 11 of <code>format/docbook/man</code>, change "<code>cp -a -- ...</code>" to "<code>cp -- ...</code>" and you're done.</p>

I've talked with a lot of PHP developers who are looking to jump from riding elephants to taming snakes.  The jump is obvious for those of us who like interpreted languages but want the feel of a really well designed language instead of getting glue all over ourselves.  I thought it was a relatively small trend, but now it seems <a href="http://www.phparch.com/">php|archtitect</a> has jumped ship too.  First it was their announcement of <a href="http://pymag.phparch.com/">Python Magazine</a>, now the January issue of php|arch supposedly contains exclusively Python articles! :-D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm always kicking around ideas for various applications.  One thing I look to off-load is user-authentication.   <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has always caught my eye when I start thinking about that, but there's been something nagging at the back of my brain about offloading something as critical as allowing users to log-in to something that is centralized.  It becomes your single point of failure.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm seeing that the unease was justified.  Had an hour or so this morning before I started work that I was going to tinker with a small Facebook app I've been cooking up, but <a href="http://forum.developers.facebook.com/viewtopic.php?id=7080">FB is completely on the fritz</a> for all small apps.  Imagine if that was powering my login mechanism...</p>

<p>Just another strike against <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/17/twitterific_distributed_versus_centraliz">centralized services</a> like Facebook and Twitter.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2008/01/03/domain51_microbench_released</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year to everyone.  Hope the holidays were good to everyone.  Mine were good; plagued by some sick time, but good nonetheless.  Now on to what this post is about...</p>

<p>Ever do the same bit of code over and over again and every time you do it think you should write something to simplify it?  I keep doing that with micro-benchmarks.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the concept, you take a snippet of code and iterate over it <i>N</i> times, the change it to use another algorithm, run it again, and compare the results.  For a formal benchmarking technique it's basically useless, but to just get a quick insight as to which of two snippets are faster it's pretty useful.</p>

<p>The code to track the time taken looks the same on every test.  Do any setup, start the timer, iterate over the code, stop the timer, and calculate and display the results.  Today when I sat down to write a few tests out to compare include_path usage in a couple of different scenarios to see what the raw performance was like I decided to whip up a quick package for creating those for me, and <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/index.php?package=Domain51_MicroBench">Domain51_MicroBench</a> was born.  </p>

<p>It can be installed the normal ways.  Do a <code>channel-discover</code> on pear.domain51.com, then install <code>d51/Domain51_MicroBench-devel</code>.  If that sentence doesn't make sense to you, this package is probably too rough around the edges for you still.  Wait for an alpha release.</p>

<p>There's no documentation or examples other than what I'm about to write, so pay close attention... :-)  You write your normal PHP file with two marker comments in it:</p>

<code><pre>&lt;?php
// setup
$path = dirname(__FILE__);
$paths = array();

// test
$paths[] = $path;</pre></code><p></p>

<p>That's it.  All of the setup code goes after "// setup", all of the test code goes after "// test".  With that file handy, run <code>d51_microbench /path/to/file.php</code> from the command line and you'll a "<code>file-bench.php</code>" file generated for you with all of the repetitive parts added for you. </p>

<p>As a word of caution, this doesn't replace a profiler and is best used with one.  Get your profiler out, start checking your script to figure out what's slow.  Once you've isolated the slow code, then, and only then, start doing some checks of various algorithms with something like Domain51_MicroBench to figure out how to make it faster.  A 75% reduction in speed on a part of your code that takes 0.05% of the time translates into saving for over 1/100<sup>th</sup> of one percent of an execution cycle.  Kind of a waste unless that's the last spot to speed your code up at.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/12/29/quick_quotes_from_the_hundred_year_langu</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">Hundred-Year Language</a> by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>.  I added it to <a href="http://del.icio.us/tswicegood/">my del.icio.us</a>, but that can't hold all of the quotes I found interesting so I thought I'd post them here.  The article is worth the read if you have a spare 10 or 15 minutes, regardless (I think) of whether you're a programmer or just someone interested in computers in general.</p>

<p>And now to the quotes:</p>

<ul><li>The more of a language you can write in itself, the better.</li>
<li>People thirty years ago would be astonished at how casually we make long distance phone calls. </li>
<li>SUVs are gross because they're the solution to a gross problem. (How to make minivans look more masculine.)</li>
<li>What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of all, is a language where you can throw together an unbelievably inefficient version 1 of a program with the least possible effort. At least, that's how we'd describe it in present-day terms. What they'll say is that they want a language that's easy to program in.</li>
<li>[Bottom up programming] tends to yield smaller, more flexible programs. It's also the best route to that holy grail, reusability</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code. It lets you accrete programs as a series of patches.</li>
<li>if you did a really good job [of writing a language], you could make a language that was ideal for writing a slow version 1, and yet with the right optimization advice to the compiler, would also yield very fast code </li>
<li>{on the difficulty of doing real research in academia} The extreme case is probably literature; people studying literature rarely say anything that would be of the slightest use to those producing it.</li>
<li>If SETI@home works, for example, we'll need libraries for communicating with aliens. Unless of course they are sufficiently advanced that they already communicate in XML.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So getting a concussion wasn't enough.  No, then I had to get vertigo and light-headedness that meant I could basically do nothing that required more than 5 minutes of thought.  Then I got better.  Then I got food poisoning...</p>

<p>Holy shit!  Give me a break.  And more than an hour and a half of sleep!</p>

<p>end rant...</p>

<p>I've been up since 3.  I laid in bed for 30 minutes before finally just getting up.  Things started to get better.  The trips to the bathroom every 15 minutes extended out to every 30 minutes.  This whole time I've felt like if I "could just throw up" I'd feel better.  20 minutes ago I finally did and I don't really feel that much better.  And now I've got that great vomit in the sinuses thing going on so every breath I take has that wonder "makes ya want to puke" smell.</p>

<p>Seriously... this is getting old.</p>

        <title>Being drunk for a week...</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/12/20/being_drunk_for_a_week</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week has been about as far from productive as it could possibly be.  I've felt like I'm drunk for the past three days.  Its getting better, but I'm not patient with this kind of thing.  I pick at the scab just to get rid of it.  It scars.  So what?  It's gone now and I can move on.</p>

<p>Having a doctor tell me "[dizziness and a stiff neck] are perfectly normal [after a concussion] and will go away on their own" isn't exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted a do A, B, and C and it will be fixed in a few hours.  It's kind of ironic considering I'm one of the first to remind people to take it easy and make sure everything heals after a serious bike accident or surgery.  </p>

<p>Throw into the mix my (borderline irrational?) fear of brain injury and I feel like I need to go for a run or a ride or jump in the boxing ring for awhile just to relieve the stress.  Except I wouldn't last 30 seconds at any one of those right now.  I've been relatively ok today, but I got up a few minutes ago to go refill my glass of water and the room was suddenly on wheels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Meg drug me along for some last minute Christmas shopping.  It wasn't that she needed my opinion on anything, it was that she wanted her personal Magellen to get her where she needed to go.  By the time we started back from Topeka, I couldn't hardly keep my eyes open.  Fatigue set in and I was out like a light before the city limits sign.  Earlier today, I feel asleep while doing some writing.  I'm sure its my body's way of handling the jet lag from last week coupled with concussion from Sunday night coupled with my trying to push through it all, but geez... I've got things to do, tasks to mark as completed.  Know all of this, why, then, body are you revolting against me?</p>

        <title>Rough couple of days</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/12/18/rough_couple_of_days/"/>
        <updated>2007-12-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/12/18/rough_couple_of_days</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I'm back from California.  Fun place, but my trips there are always too short and too crammed full of todos to actually get more than a cursory glance of the area to see if I really don't like it or if its all just a preconceived notion.  The trip back was uneventful, though I was surprised to learn that the San Jose airport doesn't open until 4:30 AM and doesn't have a single flight out before 6 AM.  You would think that with it serving as the airport to the technology hub of the US it would have flights out at all times of the day.</p>

<p>Anyhow... Sunday <a href="http://blog.accordingtomegan.com/">Meg</a> started having some lower abdominal cramps that she was rating as an 8.5 of 10, time for the ER.  They decided to put her on an IV to get some fluids back in her, and just a few minutes in to trying to get the IV in I subconsciously decided checking in for myself would be good - or something like that.  I passed out and conked my head pretty good on a door hinge.  Xrays were good and neither my cognitive or motor skills seemed impaired after I came back to full consciousness.  An hour later they discharged both of us; turns out a nasty stomach virus has been floating around Lawrence this week and Meg was one of many to turn to the ER with stomach issues.</p>

<p>Yesterday I woke up with a stiff neck, but nothing too bad.  Then last night happened.  I woke up a few times in the night and became tremendously aware that the room was spinning.  It was seriously like I had just finished off half a bottle of something.  I don't know if I became dizzy after I woke myself up, or if I woke myself up because I became dizzy, but other way it was interesting.  This morning when I woke up I wasn't as dizzy as I had been the night before, but moving quickly did make the room swoon.  So another trip to the doctor.  Like I figured, the doctor thinks I have post concussion syndrome, or <abbr title="post concussion syndrome">PCS</abbr> and there's not much to do about it other than let it run its course.  I wanted to double check though.  Since my line of work is all mental, any damage to my brain could be a pretty big deal if I don't catch it early. :-)</p>

<p>Anyhow, I should be ok.  I was more balanced and had better eyesight than the doctor.  Hopefully the medicine will keep the room from spinning when I stand up without rendering my brain useless in the process.</p>

<p>At this rate, driving to Denver to catch a flight would have been nearly as quick. :-/</p>

Both the <a href="http://speeddream.com/">wheel builder</a> and the <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/">pragmatic guru</a>.  The latter just announced <a href="http://pragprog.com/">his company's</a> new Wishlist 3.0 (or that's what I would have called it).  </p>

<blockquote><p>... we wanted to create a kind of wish list feature for our shiny new online store. It would be a system that would allow our readers tell their non-technical relatives and friends the titles that they'd love to see under the tree.</p>

<p>So I got to planning. We've got all the power we need to create something special. I sketched out the mother of all wish lists, with referral logic, automated suggestions based on other people's wish lists, privacy settings, e-mail and web fulfillment, and so on and so on. It was to be a work of art.</p>

<p>Then, for once, I stopped to think.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then they created a <a href="http://pragprog.com/forms/wishlist.pdf">PDF</a> with their titles on it so people could print it out and give it to anyone.  Any good programmer can create an application; it takes a great one to realize that sometimes it isn't necessary.</p>

        <title>Repository Pattern in PHP</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/11/20/repository_pattern_in_php/"/>
        <updated>2007-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/11/20/repository_pattern_in_php</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I worked with <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh Eichorn</a> a couple of years ago, we were designing the framework that our company's software was built on.  I wanted to move more toward a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository</a> style architecture instead of interacting directly with the database via streamlined a <abbr title="Data Access Object">DAO</abbr>.  Josh argued at the time that dealing directly with the database was a better option.  It removed a layer of complexity and he could go to the bookstore down the street and pick one of a few hundred books on SQL off of the shelf and give it to someone new to bring them up-to-speed on how to access the system.  As an added bonus, you have all of the power of SQL at your fingertips whenever you need to do something complex.  His argument won me over, and until this past week I've viewed that as probably the most sane way to go.</p>

<p>The problem with this method isn't so much with the exposed SQL.  If that was the only method of access, I would be fine with it.  Programmers are a lazy bunch, however, and one of us always ends up adding a findById($id) method and it's off to the races.  Next thing you know, there's helpers for all sorts of queries, with overrides in the form of optional parameters, calls to other helpers that generate an associative array that's used by the method to build a query that's sent to the data access layer and...  I could go on.  Now, what started out as the simplest solution has morphed into this unrecognizable mishmash of SQL, code and convention.</p>

<p>So, my new motto:</p>

<blockquote><p>All SQL should be hidden to protect developers from themselves and allow someone else who knows a bit about mildly complex SQL statements to build the queries as needed. - <i>Travis Swicegood, November 2007</i>, motto subject to change...</p></blockquote>

<p>Here's the problem.  You have widgets, each widget has a creator, and N users assigned to it.  Your query must return all widgets that the current user is either the creator of, or one of the users assigned to it.  If you've ever done an <em>OR</em> query across multiple tables, you've already seen the problem when you imagined the SQL that would normally be generated for that query.</p>

<code><pre>SELECT
    widgets.*
FROM
    widgets
    LEFT JOIN widgets_users USING(widget_id)
WHERE
    widgets.creator_id = :current_user_id
    OR widgets_users.user_id = :current_user_id</pre></code><p></p>

<p>Now I've just created a full table scan of widgets_users.  A system with a few hundred widgets and a few hundred users and each widget with a few users assigned to it, it's not unreasonable to expect that widgets_users table to end up the ten or twenty thousand records quickly.  Add more widgets and more users, the problem keeps getting worse.</p>

<p>In order for that data to be retrieved at a reasonable speed, the best solution I found was to create a derived table from two select statements that are unioned, each containing their half of the or criteria:</p>

<code><pre>SELECT
    widgets.*
FROM
    (
        SELECT * FROM widgets WHERE creator_id = :current_user_id
        UNION
        SELECT 
            widgets.*
        FROM
            widgets
            INNER JOIN widgets_users USING(widget_id)
        WHERE
            widgets_users.user_id = :current_user_id
    ) as widgets</pre></code><p></p>

<p>Raise your hand if that was the first query that popped into your head when you thought "any widget that a user created or has been assigned".  It wasn't mine either, but that's the one that executed with the least amount of overhead on some work I did last week.  In the straight SQL codebase, you change the query and move on, but in the second, more common, helper-oriented codebase that I described earlier, you more often than not end up with code that looks like this:</p>

<code><pre>$model = new Widget();
$data = $model->getAll(
    $current_user, 
    array(
        'extra_tables' => 'LEFT JOIN widgets_users USING (widget_id)',
        'extra_criteria' => 'OR widgets_users.user_id = :current_user_id',
    )
);
echo new GenericListView($data);</pre></code><p></p>

<p>That last line was just wishful thinking on my part.  ;-)  Most of the time it's assigned to something like Smarty to do the templating instead of letting code to it.  But I digress, the problem with this half and half method is that now I have to touch multiple areas to get the change in the query that I want.  That's if there's enough flex points in the code above to allow me to inject my own implementation as the query is being built.  In the above code, so many assumptions are being made that you almost have to scrap the existing behavior and start fresh with a new method to get what you want.</p>

<p>The Repository pattern helps remove this problem.  All developer interaction is at the meta level, they could care less where the data is coming from.</p>

<code><pre>$repo = new Repository();
$criteria = new Criteria('Widget');
$criteria->addFilter(
    new Criteria_Filter(Widget::creator, $current_user),
    new Criteria_Filter(Widget_Users::user, $current_user)
);
$widgets = $repo->matching($criteria);

echo new GenericListView($widgets);</pre></code><p></p>

<p>Now my Repository object gets to build the entire query and return the data.  Even if it doesn't have the flexibility to inject custom query templates directly into the system, my changes are much more localized and hidden behind the firewall of the Repository object.  Assuming I create a lot of list views, it could even be decorated to simplify the code:</p>

<code><pre>$criteria = new Criteria_CreatorOrAssignedUser($current_user);
$repo = new WidgetRepository();
$widgets = $repo->matching($criteria);
echo new GenericListView($widgets);</pre></code><p></p>

<p>This could be achieved by adding helpers in to the straight SQL model making this approach seem like the logical conclusion to adding helper methods and objects as you move from a straight SQL model to the helper mishmash, but there is a distinct difference between the two.  It is subtle, and 100% perception, but there nonetheless.  With the helper model developers are thinking in SQL - i.e., I'm hiding the query that's being built.  With the Repository model, developers are thinking in code - i.e., I'm working on this dataset, wherever it comes from.</p>

<p>In the above code, there is a specialized, domain-specific criteria and decorated the repository so it automatically assumes we're after a Widet, but now all that layer is expected to do is query whatever data source it can and retrieve the data.  All my client code cares about is that it has a list to work with, all my Repository code cares about is that it can create that list.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: When I finished this article Sunday night I realized that I had almost argued myself in a circle and decided to hold off the final edit.  As a I edited it this, I realized that a properly separated SQL based can still work, but 9 times out of 10, it doesn't because the layers get mixed up.  If the Smarty evangelists are to be believed, programmers can't be trusted with themselves.  In that case, SQL with helpers can't be done properly and the Repository is the last refuge for those of us who want to make sure there's a proper split between the data/storage layer and the domain layer.</p>

Once that's installed, just do your normal <em>pear install phpt/PHPT_Ensure</em> to get it installed.  This new package adds an ensure section and the ability to handle assertions with a much cleaner API.  A test might look something like this:</p>

<code><pre>--TEST--
Ensure string is properly set
--ENSURE--
--FILE--
&lt;?php

$string = 'Hello World!';
ensure($string)->equals('Hello World!');

?>
===DONE===
--EXPECT--
===DONE===</pre></code><p></p>

<p>And you're off.  No more assert() function calls necessary.  It still needs some tweaking, but it's a usable 0.1 alpha package.</p>

<p>One area that I'm looking for input on is how to show the differences between two arrays.  One option is to do a var_export() of each array and and then display a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format">unified diff</a> of the two.  This seems rather low-tech to me, but I'm not actually sure how to approach a change.  The only decent thought I've had so far is to do something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote><p>value is expected to be equal to an array<br />
values expected[0][1] and actual[0][1] were not equal at character 0</p></blockquote>

<p>That assumes that the equals was based a multi-dimensional array where [0][1] => 'foobar' and the actual value was [0][1] => 'barfoo' or some other string not equal to foobar.  This is also an issue with comparing objects.  Is a simple failed expectation message enough, or does it need something more verbose?  And more verbose as in creating a Reflection and figuring out exactly where things were different, or is something else better?</p>

<p>There's still a lot of issues to be worked out before it gets to a 1.0, but hopefully it'll provide you with something useful in the meantime.  As always, please <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpt/issues/list">report any issues</a> you find.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is just something about my nature, but I can't look at "sub-optimal" code and not want to start refactoring.  It's gotten so bad lately, I think I have <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Refactoring">OCR</abbr> Syndrome: Obsessive Compulsive Refactoring Syndrome.  What?  You say that's not a disease?!  Well that's because you don't suffer from it! ;-)</p>

<p>Of course, it hasn't helped that my night time reading of late has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRefactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code%2Fdp%2F0201485672%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1195137997%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Refactoring</a> by Fowler.  It's been a few years since I've picked it up and read through it, but the other evening, for some reason, it seemed like a good choice.  Nearly every single refactoring listed in there brings to mind some code I've seen in the last 6 months in various places.  I wonder if it's considered rude to send a copy of that out as a Christmas present? ;-)</p>

<p>At any rate, it's reminded exactly how valuable a concept it really is.  The other day I was asked by a colleague at <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a> what books or websites I frequently referred to when doing performance work so he could pass them on to other developers in the company.  I immediately responded with <i>Refactoring</i>.  In my opinion, it is ten times easier to make good code run fast, than to take bad code and make it run fast.   Of course, you know what they say about opinions...</p>

        <title>Wrap up of WebDev '07</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/11/11/wrap_up_of_webdev_07/"/>
        <updated>2007-11-11T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/11/11/wrap_up_of_webdev_07</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>Author's note:</em> I started writing this the Thursday after the summit and just haven't had a chance to sit down and finish the whole thing yet.  I haven't edited it to make the time line be coherent, so that might throw you.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm back in Lawrence now.  Blogging was light at this summit because I just didn't get into it - the blogging that was.  Monday morning was the company wide Q3 meeting that I was attending remotely, so my attention was divided the entire morning.  By the time lunch was over and the speakers started back up, my mind was fried, so I decided not to do a blow-by-blow.</p>

<p>In attendance were all of the usual suspects, sort of like a <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com/main/index.php/episodes:20071018">Ramblecast</a> reunion.  In retrospect, it was odd that no one from Zend was there though.</p>

<p>A lot of the talks covered some of the same ground that was covered at <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php?cat=172">MTS</a> earlier in the year.  IIS7 still looks good, but I'm not ditching my Linux servers for it.  The PowerShell presentation was good.  I picked up a bit more about it this time and there were a few of the devs available to answer questions about it.  The one issue I have with PowerShell is that you can't swap out the scripting language that it uses to get the grammar of Python or Ruby via IronPython/Ruby.  At least yet.  It's apparently coded in such a way that it would be possible with some tweaking, but that tweaking isn't on the agenda.</p>

<p>There was a lot of talk of Expression and Silverlight.  Expression was presented to the wrong PHP crowd at this meeting.  Most of the folks there might switch to a Visual Studio if it was up to spec, but Expression would be a step back in terms of functionality.  For the casual coder though who's just interested in making their WordPress blog look pretty, Expression would probably fit the bill.  Silverlight wasn't of interest to me just because I don't really use Flash (its main competitor).  The technology looked cool, but just not something that I'll be reaching for anytime soon as I don't have a need for it.</p>

<p>They did some attendee presentations.  I asked the guys at Gallery on a few things, one of which was integration with Amazon S3 for image storing.  It's been requested and is in the list of a few hundred feature requests to get implemented.  Just another reason to get Domain51_Service_Amazon_S3 wrapped up (I swear, a few days with nothing else to do and its done).  </p>

<p>I also asked them for their thoughts on using the PEAR Installer instead of rolling their own remote plug-in system since their current system doesn't allow for plug-in channels.  They were open to it, but cautious and for good reason.  They would be giving up control of something that's pretty integral to the security of their system.  One slip up in the installer and the whole system could be toast.  I pointed them to <a href="http://pear.chiaraquartet.net/index.php?package=MyBlog">MyBlog</a>, but it's not the most elegant example and only conveys its power to Greg, myself, and maybe a half dozen other people.  I'm going to have to write up an example of fully embedding the PEAR Installer within a distributable (as in unzip and go) app to show people.</p>

<p>Also interesting is Liz Smith's work on <a href="http://svn.bluga.net/win32api/trunk/">Win::UI</a> which will make the entire win32api available inside PHP.  Why someone would want to do that is beyond me, but it's still cool to see PHP starting to move toward possible use in real apps for rapid prototyping.</p>

<p>Back to the MS presentations, the presentation of John Bocharov - manager of the ext/sqlsrv project - was interesting.  Microsoft is creating an SQL Server extension for PHP that will actually be fast.  The only problem with it currently is that it runs only on Windows.  The implementation is apparently just based on a ODBC connection, so I'm not sure what the hold up to getting it to *nix platforms is, but I and several other people said that the gold standard isn't creating extensions for PHP, it's creating extensions for PHP that work everywhere.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a good summit.  The best part was the one on one "sessions" while waiting on another presentation or Monday evening (even though the Tap House was a bit cramped).  Those tend to veer off in to more interesting territory.  Just the fact that one person is standing behind a podium or wearing a microphone or simply controlling the projector makes the conversation feel one way.  That said, all of the presenters were eager to engage anyone with questions, either during the presentation or afterward.  They <em>are</em> trying.</p>

<p>Coming away from this summit, my opinion of MS hasn't changed.  I had a neutral opinion of them going in and I still have it.  I'm personally going to need more incentive to change than a few days of hearing about all the new glittery projects.  Although, there was apparently some <a href="http://blog.preinheimer.com/index.php?/archives/250-IIS7-The-Leap-of-Faith.html">vodka-flavored kool-aid</a> that I missed out on.  Had I got mixed up in that, my opinions might be different. :-)</p>

        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/26/fluent_api_here_i_come/"/>
        <updated>2007-10-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/26/fluent_api_here_i_come</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that bugs me about PHP is that fluent APIs that were made possible by method chaining in PHP 5 are hindered by the new keyword.  In Python or Javascript it's possible to instantiate the object and continue chaining it.  An example in PHP syntax would be:</p>

<code><pre>$result = new SQL()->select('*')
                   ->from('users')
                   ->where('username')
                   ->like('travis%')
                   ->execute();
</pre></code><p></p>

<p>In PHP, that "new" kills it.  However, this code would work:</p>

<code><pre>$result = SQL()->select('*')
               ->from('users')
               ->where('username')
               ->like('travis%')
               ->execute();
</pre></code><p></p>

<p>All you have to do is define a function that has the same name as your class that wraps the new and off you go.  This falls into that "I guess I should have known" category.  Functions and classes aren't the same in PHP and since it will never going down the everything is an object road (unfortunately - if you've ever programmed in a language that has it you know what I mean) it would make sense that there wouldn't be any name clashing between a function and class of the same name.</p>

<p>This means I can start removing all of the factory methods I have that do nothing but instantiate an object and return it.  Now I'll just slap a function in and away we go.</p>

<p>As an extra benefit, interfaces fall into the same category as classes.  You can't have an interface and an object both named SQL, but either one with a function is fine.  This gives all sorts of new possibilities to a Dependency Injection Manager:</p>

<code><pre>interface SQL {
    public function query($query);
}
$sql = SQL();
$sql instanceof SQL_Driver_MySQL;</pre></code><p></p>

<p>Now, if I could just find a use for a DI manager that couldn't be solved by other means. :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the "are you serious?" category today, Amazon was awarded a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2vsvky">patent</a> on adding a string to the end of a URL to find something such as:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/21/new_release_phpt">http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/21/new_release_phpt</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I've been using this style of URL since '04 on this site and '03 on another and 2000 on other sites.  That seems like they ripped of my idea and patented it.  Anyone lawyers out there want to take up the case? :-D</p>

<p>Serious though, A9 wasn't the first, nor will it be the last.  All this does is weaken the overall acceptance of patent law.  Laws require either willing or forced acceptance by those under the law in order for the "rule of law" to prevail.  If laws are unjust, or just <a href="http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/kansas/">plain stupid</a> people will ignore them.  When was the last time you heard someone in Topeka get ready to break into a rousing chorus of the alphabet on a Friday night only to stop cause <em>The Man</em> might be listening?  Patents like this reduce people's acceptance of the patent law, thus weakening the law in its entirety.</p>

<p>I love patents.  They're a great way to stimulate invention.  But please, please, <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">USPTO</a>, actually research your patent submissions.  Or at least the ones relating to software.  Go ahead and keep letting companies <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/life-patent.htm">patent human life</a>.</p>

        <title>New release: PHPT</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/21/new_release_phpt/"/>
        <updated>2007-10-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/21/new_release_phpt</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a few months of one or two nights a week spent hacking away and a couple of marathon sessions, I've finished work on the first usable release of PHPT, what I hope to become the successor to PEAR_RunTest in PEAR2.  Since this is usable and PEAR2 is still being worked out, I've decided to release this as a standalone package for the time being with the intent of bundling it with Pyrus or including it directly in PEAR2 when PEAR2 is realized.</p>

<p>This provides the majority of the functionality provided by PEAR's <code>pear run-tests</code> command via its own <code>phpt</code> command and it can even provide pear style output:</p>

<p><code>$ phpt -rq --reporter Pear /path/to/tests</code></p>

<p>Functions like:</p>

<p><code>$ pear -rq /path/to/tests</code></p>

<p>Of course, if you leave "-- reporter Pear" out you'll get the PHPT output which provides a cross between PHPUnit and SimpleTest output.  I'll be surprised if this works on Windows (yet).  PEAR_RunTest punts on Windows by pushing everything through output buffering.  I may yet do that, but I want to explore other options first.</p>

<p>I'll post more as I get a chance.  In the meantime, I've started a <a href="https://svn.phpt.info/pocketguide/trunk/">pocket guide</a> in the vain of PHPUnit's excellent reference.  Right now it's written in Markdown format so it's accessible without anything but a text viewer.</p>

<p>To install PHPT:</p>

<p><code>$ pear channel-discover channel.phpt.info<br />
$ pear install phpt/PHPT_Core-alpha</code></p>

<p>Package page is at: <a href="http://channel.phpt.info/index.php?package=PHPT_Core">http://channel.phpt.info/index.php?package=PHPT_Core</a><br />

No, it was when someone mentioned <a href="http://terrychay.com/">Terry Chay's</a> <a href="http://works.phparch.com/c/schedule/talk/d2s5/2">Internet is an Ogre</a> talk.  Not the <em>e</em>.  Ogre, as in monster, Shrek, big green smelly thing.</p>

<p>I don't know how many times I'd seen that topic listed by various people online, and every - I mean absolutely <strong>every</strong> time I read it - my mind transmuted it into <em>orgy</em>.  Seriously.  I hadn't read the description of his talk, hadn't attended it, and until yesterday had never heard anyone call it by its name.</p>

<p>I even had the whole idea of the talk worked out.  Web 2.0's all about sharing everything with everyone and right now everyone's getting a little dirty.  It made sense to me.  Looks like <a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/article/zendcon-talk-lunch20.shtml#comment-194212">I wasn't the only one</a> to make that mistake.</p>

        <title>Twitterific?  Distributed versus centralized systems</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/17/twitterific_distributed_versus_centraliz/"/>
        <updated>2007-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/17/twitterific_distributed_versus_centraliz</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, while catching up on some blogs I came across Chris Shiflett's <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/oct/i-almost-get-twitter">I Almost Get Twitter</a> post.  I've managed to avoid <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> so far, but decided to check it out yesterday (you can <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood/">follow me</a> if that's your thing).  It seems like a cool concept, but I keep thinking its just a fancy micro-blog with a built in aggregator and a very nice, centrally located point of failure.</p>

<p>Case in point, yesterday when I was filling out the registration form I put in my normal username, tswicegood.  On the first pass it told me that the username wasn't available.  I go to that user's supposed page to see what's up and I get the standard "I didn't find it, but try a search why don't ya?" page.  I switch tabs back to the registration, enter my username again, and now I get the green go-ahead telling me that the name is available.</p>

<p>A couple of other things didn't work like I expected.  I know I updated my profile yesterday with my website and name, but this morning they weren't there when I loaded it up.  In browsing around for people I'd be interesting in following, I kept getting some nice javascript alerts while just scanning the page if I had clicked "follow" one too many times.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, they done a lot of work to get something like this off the ground.  The tie-in with all of the various IM and SMS services is pretty cool.  I use Adium and my Jabber account to get notifications and send updates.  The site is like any other Rails site, easy on the eyes and relatively straight forward to navigate, but I kept thinking "why am I not just hosting this myself?"</p>

<p>It goes something like this in my head...  I setup lifestream/twitter/junk/random/whatever.travisswicegood.com.  It's a blog in miniature that I impose length limits on myself as to what I'll post so it can be sent via SMS.  Of course, it would be available as an Atom/RSS feed so you could follow it at your leisure, or you could "Follow" me by giving me your site your whatever.yourname.com site and my site will add you as an Observer to be updated every time I add something.</p>

<p>Both sites implement a standard API for notifying the other of an update.  The updates could be pushed, but I would probably just do a ping so you can download the update now or queue it for later when bandwidth is cheaper or you're actually going to read it.</p>

<p>Now we have a decentralized system so when my server goes down, everybody else keeps clicking along.  There's only two things that it doesn't do:</p>

<ul><li>there's no SMS/IM gateway in place</li>
<li>there's no random social element to it</li></ul>

<p>The first is easy enough to address.  Jabber/GoogleTalk uses an open protocol so you can talk with them without any issue.  AOL also has an API for talking to AIM and I imagine Microsoft and Yahoo! can't be fair behind if they don't already have APIs accessible.  AIM also offers IM to SMS messaging via their client.  If that works via the API you've got text'ing for free.  If not, there's plenty of SMS gateways (free and fee) available to fill that need if you have it.</p>

<p>The second is where sites like Twitter come in.  You have centralized sites that will aggregate everyone's update.  Those aggregators will ping people to let them know when particular keyword that they're tracking is noticed and any number of other conditions nobody's thought of.  If you provide an open API to be an aggregator, all sorts of new uses could come up.  I could aggregate for my family, planet-php.net could aggregate for PHP developers, companies could aggregate their employee's messages, etc., etc.</p>

<p>And for the first time in a long time, I'm at a loss for how to wrap a post up.  I guess that's what I get for posting something that's a random thought process from the drive to and from KC last night :-)  For all of my rabid readers, it might interest you to know that this is my 1,000<sup>th</sup> post.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So my free time of late (what there is of it) has been spent on a project that's getting really close to v0.1 release.  In other words, its first functional release.  As a teaser to what it might entail, consider this code that I just ran on my server:</p>

<pre>$ ./scripts/phpt --recursive --reporter PearQuiet tests \

<p>If you've ever run a test using the PEAR installer or know what a <code>.phpt</code> file looks like, you might be able to guess what I've been up. :-)  Stay tuned for more info...</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/11/why_class_inheritance_sucks</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bernard Sumption has a post titled <a href="http://www.berniecode.com/writing/inheritance/"><i>Inheritance is evil, and must be destroyed: part 1</i></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>All of the pain caused by inheritance can be traced back to the fact that inheritance forces 'is-a' rather than 'has-a' relationships. If class R2Unit extends Droid, then a R2Unit is-a Droid. If class Jedi contains an instance variable of type Lightsabre, then a Jedi has-a Lightsabre.</p>

<p>The difference between is-a and has-a relationships is well known and a fundamental part of OOAD, but what is less well known is that almost every is-a relationship would be better off re-articulated as a has-a relationship.</p></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't have said it better myself.  Remember that next time you type <code>extends</code> and re-think the implementation before taking the easy route.  Unless, of course, you just want to be like Java ;-)</p>

        <updated>2007-10-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/10/11/title_12</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/11/why_class_inheritance_sucks#comments">comments</a> of my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/11/why_class_inheritance_sucks">previous post</a> - <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/11/why_class_inheritance_sucks"><em>Why class inheritance sucks</em></a> - I got a comment that shows some of the confusion with <em>composition</em> versus <em>inheritance</em> in the world of objects.  <a href="http://www.sfsmith.com/blog/">Sandy</a> <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/11/why_class_inheritance_sucks#c8070">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>...I have cases where, say, if I'm building a CMS, I have a ContentObject class that has generalized methods to determine where it's been published, etc. If I have two types of content, Document and Event, I fail to see why extending ContentObject for each one is bad.</p>

<p>Now if I have another type, Author, and each Document needs an Author, it's a has-a relationship. Extending Author to get the author's name as part of the Document would be wrong. Instead it should be $document->author->getName();</p>

<p>But in the first case, if I need to implement a publishTo($page_id) method, I'd rather do it once in ContentObject, so I can change that implementation in one place. Am I missing something that makes that a bad idea?</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a pretty standard case where it looks like the best route is <code>Event extends ContentObject</code>, especially with a <code>publishTo()</code> method that seems so universal.  Given any number of factors, this might actually be the best route for any given project.  I approach <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> from a flexibility standpoint with one of its biggest flex-points being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loose coupling</a> which in turn promotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability">reusability</a>.  I'm going to use <code>Event</code> as a hypothetical example.</p>

<p>In the normal case, you might want to add it to a page of other events, making sure its ordered correctly, etc., etc.  What happens when it needs to update Google Calendar, shoot off an SMS to the administrators, <em>and</em> publish to a page particular <code>ContentObject</code> page?  If that happens, <code>Event->publishTo($page_id)</code> gets:</p>

<ul><li>relegated to a call from some other method such as <code>Event->publish()</code></li>
<li>gets repurposed to the point that <code>publishTo($page_id)</code> doesn't adequately convey what it's actually doing</li>
<li>or worse it gets ignored when someone new writes the <code>publish()</code> code because they weren't aware of the inherited method</li></ul>

<p>Assuming we want avoid all of these, a composite in the simplest form would look something like this:</p>

<code><pre>class Event {
  ...  logic and such ...

  public function publish() {
    $content_object = new ContentObject();
    $content_object->publish_data('some-page', $this);
    $google_cal = new GoogleCal();
    $google_cal->add_event($this);
    $sms = new SMSSender('admins@example.mobi');
    $sms->send_event($this);
  }
}</pre></code><p></p>

<p>This gives us the composition and moves the logic of saving out to other objects, but isn't very flexible.  Every new publishing type requires a change to <code>Event::publish()</code>.  This is a place where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor Pattern</a> proves useful.  The <code>publish()</code> method becomes:</p>

<code><pre>public function publish(EventPublisher $publisher) {
  $publisher->publishEvent($this);
}</pre></code><p></p>

<p>With that, you completely externalize the act of publishing an <code>Event</code> to any object that implements the <code>EventPublisher</code> interface.  Now any object can be used for publishing an <code>Event</code> without any changes required to the actual <code>Event</code> code.  Your commit messages will be shorter and less code will have to be written which should both translate into less of a likelihood for bugs to get introduced (not that they'd make it past that stellar <abbr title="Test Driven Design">TDD</abbr> test suite you've coded ;-)).  And you can still share your <code>ContentObject::publishTo()</code> functionality:</p>

<code><pre>class ContentObject implements EventPublisher, DocumentPublisher
{
  public function publishTo($page_id) {
    ... do publishing ...
  }

  public function publishEvent(Event $event) {
    $this->name = $event->name;
    ... etc., etc. ...
    $this->publishTo('some-page');
  }

  public function publishDocument(Document $document) {
    $this->name = $document->filename;
    ...  etc., etc. ...
    $this->publishTo('some-page');
  }
}</pre></code><p></p>

<p>The careful observer will notice that while <code>ContentObject</code>uses the property <code>$name</code> in the above example, the property that <code>Event</code> and <code>Document</code> use is different.  With the above functionality you don't end up having to shoe-horn property names into specific schemas because of inheritance allowing the <em>best practice</em> to dominate the code instead of the <em>best choice</em>.</p>

<p>And now the original "what if" problem.  Publishing all of the code might look something this:</p>

<code><pre>$publisher = new MultipleEventPublisher(array(
  new ContentObject('calendar-page'),
  new GoogleCal('my-events'),
  new EventSMSPublisher('8885554321@example.mobi')
));
$event->publish($publisher);</pre></code><p></p>

<p>Now instead of <code>Event</code> <em>being</em> a <code>ContentObject</code>, it <em>uses</em> one.  The shift paradigm is subtle, but something that can help produce better, more flexible code.</p>

        <title>Funny __toString() behavior</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/09/25/funny_tostring_behavior/"/>
        <updated>2007-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/09/25/funny_tostring_behavior</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here's another behavior in PHP that's not quite what I expected, but not all that surprising.</p>

<code><pre>&lt;?php

class SomeClass {
  public function __toString() {
    return "hello!";
  }
}

class SomeOtherClass {
  public function __toString() {
    return new SomeClass();
  }
}

echo new SomeOtherClass();
?>
</pre></code><p></p>

<p>Now, doesn't it seem that the echo should carry through to <code>SomeClass::__toString()</code>?  You'd think; but you get a fatal error instead.  It the "fix" isn't difficult:</p>

<code><pre>class SomeOtherClass {
  public function __toString() {
    <strong>return (string)new SomeClass();</strong>
  }
</pre></code><p></p>

<p>And from a performance standpoint, it is better to require a string be returned than try to guess.  Seemed odd, though, given PHP's loose typing.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past six weeks or so has been a whirlwind.  Seriously, crazy.  It started back the end of July with the property management company at the condo I was renting botching a notice about Remus.  They sent the wrong "notice" to let us know we needed to get rid of Remus or get out of the condo.  No problem, I'm sure it's just the form letter and we can work it out.  Then the guy that handled the property starts not returning calls.  Ok, so I'm out of here.  Flag isn't the easiest place to find a place to rent, especially in August right before <a href="http://www.nau.edu">NAU</a> starts up, so my options are pretty much set for me.  Meg and I had been talking about heading back to the Midwest this fall to get closer to family so we just accelerated that, at an uncomfortably fast pace.</p>

<p>We spent the past six weeks bunking with family trying to find the right place, and two weekend's ago we happened upon the practically perfect digs on an afternoon outing to Lawrence, Kansas.  So, now it looks like I <em>am</em> in Kansas (sorry, couldn't resist).</p>

        <title>Quick review of Zend_Log</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/09/14/quick_review_of_zend_log/"/>
        <updated>2007-09-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/09/14/quick_review_of_zend_log</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was asked to do a quick review of Zend_Log the other day to see what I thought of it.  Was it good enough to use instead of trying to roll your own or relying on the outdated Log package in PEAR?  I should qualify "outdated".  By that I mean it uses PEAR_Error and jumps through hoops to work in PHP4.  That's a pretty limiting definition of outdated, I know, but that's the one I'm working from right now.</p>

<p>Back on topic.  The short answer to is Zend_Log good (enough): yes; the long answer, no.  First off, it does what it needs to do without too much fuss.  It's <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.html">documentation</a> is excellent, it has no outside dependencies, and plenty of flex points.  All in all a well put together package.</p>

<p>But...  It has a few fatal flaws in my opinion.  First off, there is redundancy within the code.  The one I noticed the most was filtering.  When you call the <code>log()</code> method, it runs through all of its filters.  A filter can effectively veto a log entry.  Nice functionality to have, but only if you're using it.  To me that functionality seems like something that should happen at the writer level, however.  Open up the base writer object, and sure enough it does.  So you have two levels of filtering, something that's probably not going to be used by many users.</p>

<p>I would have created a <code>Zend_Log_Writer_Filterable</code> object that would add filtering in if you needed it.  To filter, you instantiate a Filterable type and one of the options passed into it would be the end writer you want to use, stream, db, etc.  This gives you the functionality that could be very useful in certain cases, but keeps it from causing performance hits against the main class.</p>

<p>Second up, the way writers themselves are handled.  If I'm looking for speed, I want to talk directly to the object that's going to be writing the data.  In the case of Zend_Log, the writers aren't accessible directly, and if they were instantiated directly their API is different from Zend_Log.  </p>

<p>I put together a simple, some might say simplistic, <a href="http://plumb.domain51.com/sandbox/callback/callback.php">test</a> (<a href="http://plumb.domain51.com/sandbox/callback/callback.phps">source</a>) to see what kind of effect a straight double-callback would cause.  To make it complete, I compared it with iterating over an array with just one value to see what kind of hit the code would take for the array being in place.</p>

<p>The results were as I expected, though a little more dramatic than I thought they would be.  The double-call - calling a method that only calls another - causes a hit of more than 100% when compared to calling that method directly.  If you take that, and add a <code>foreach()</code> over an array with one value, it takes a hit of another 50%.  To me, that means that Zend_Log::log() is 200% slower than it could be if I could access the writer directly.</p>

<p>The flexibility is good, but this code puts it above performance.  Having multiple loggers and filters in the base class is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionality_creep">kitchen sink syndrome</a>.  In the cases where it's needed, special writers could have stepped in to fill the void.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think the <code>Zend_Log</code> code does too much.  In my opinion, it should serve as a Factory for creating new loggers, and I would give it the ability to work as a container for any writer if it was instantiated directly.</p>

<p>Is the code good enough?  Yeah, if you're in a pinch or don't really care about milliseconds.  If you're looking for a class with a very narrow - possibly even limiting - scope that's as fast as it can be, this one isn't it.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: I just ran the same test code above on a server with Zend Platform installed.  The single and double callbacks are basically the same (faster, but still a similar difference).  The multi-callbacks however ran much slower in comparison.  The double was 215% slower than the straight single, and the multi was 242% slower than the double.  That means that running an opcode cache with an array when a single value could have been used causes a huge performance hit.  Granted, huge is getting into thousandths of a second, but they all add up.</p>

From the itinerary it sounds like there might be some overlap from the previous summit I was at, but there's some specific PHP sessions at this one that sound interesting.  I know there's a camp inside MS that really wants PHP and Windows to get along better, so it'll be interesting to see what they're up to.  Thus far, nothing's come up about an <abbr title="non-disclosure agreement">NDA</abbr>, so I'll be blogging it up again... just fair warning to my non-computer geek reader.</p>

I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/09/01/the_perfect_php_editor">posted</a> a few days ago lamenting the fact that Komodo wasn't fully open-source, and what does <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> do?  They announce the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/openkomodo/">Open Komodo Project</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like Komodo IDE isn't going away, but with the Komodo platform open-source, it wouldn't be out of the question for someone to develop various open-source extension to whatever comes of the Open Komodo project that would replace the functionality in Komodo IDE.  The only thing I hope they pull out of the commercial version is the source control.  Having CVS/SVN access inside an open-source editor that is essentially Komodo IDE would be sweet.</p>

        <title>The perfect PHP editor?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing around with Eclipse PDT a bit the last few days.  This summer I've been using Komodo IDE, but recently I've been wanting something open-source with a bit more native feel in Mac OS X.  As PDT gets closer to its 1.0 release, I thought revisiting it would be good.</p>

<p>The last time I tried it back in July, it didn't even work.  Seriously, the all-in-one package was so botched it couldn't even recognize php files.  I figured I would give it a little while and come back to it.  The draw of using an open source editor is really strong for me; all of my personal code is open source, so why shouldn't I be creating it with a tool that shares those values?  I like Komodo, I don't think I would have shelled out $300 for it.  I managed to get a free copy for a quick and dirty MySQL extension I put together for it this past spring.</p>

<p>So, I downloaded Eclipse and gave it a go again.  As my last post said, I still had trouble with it.  I played with it a bit this morning, but the feel of it just isn't quite right.  Maybe I've spent too much time in a Mozilla land?</p>

<p>Anyhow, I guess I'll be sticking with Komodo IDE for now, if for no other reason that PDT isn't compelling enough to switch (yet).  Maybe if they get all of the kinks worked out so it "just works", but until then.  Of course, if ActiveState were to release Komodo IDE (or at least add debugging and Subversion to Komodo Edit) under an open source license of some flavor or another, well then it's a different story all together.  </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I do.  I occasionally even ride them still :-)</p>

<p>Wow, this year has been really tough on me in the riding department and I'm not 100% sure why.  I was never able to get into a rhythm at all.  I've done a few races this year, very few, but felt strong at the ones I've been at.  Not top of my game strong, but an improvement over last year.</p>

<p>I like to blame work related BS, but that's not the case (entirely).  Starting the year off looking for a job wasn't fun.  I spent most of spring in a "should be perfect" job, but there wasn't much rhyme to it which threw things off even further.  In May I got on at Sugar and things got into a rhythm again and the job's going good, but I'd already lost my cycling momentum.  So I don't know... </p>

<p>Anyhow, that's why I haven't been posting about cycling.  It;s just been in a lull this year.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/08/30/i_have_to_be_missing_the_obvious_right</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been meaning to play with the new <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pdt">PDT</a> (PHP Development Toolkit) and tonight I decided to.  I find it amusing that this project aims to be <em>the</em> PHP editor, yet the defacto PHP test format, phpt, isn't recognized as a PHP file by default.  Shows you priorities I guess...</p>

<p>But that's not my problem; I figured out how to get that working quickly enough.  What's causing issues is <i>Run As > PHP Script</i> which isn't outputting anything.  If I use <i>Debug As</i> I get the output I expect, albeit with a stop or two in the process when the debugger halts the execution.  This seems like something obvious.  No, I'm sure it has to be something obvious.  Where's my output?  I've checked the Console (where it is outputted like I expected when I'm debugging), the Browser Output... nada.</p>

<p>Anyone out there know what I'm missing?  I'm using xdebug2 with a hand-compiled version of 5.2.3.  I installed PDT using the all-in-one S20070826-M3.  It works as expected running from the console, via Apache and mod_php, and from Komodo IDE.  This one just doesn't make sense.</p>

        <title>Some new PEAR channel code</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/08/19/some_new_pear_channel_code/"/>
        <updated>2007-08-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/08/19/some_new_pear_channel_code</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its been awhile since I've posted anything of any real consequence to the site, yeah, I know.  Just been that kind of few weeks.  In my spare time I've been playing with some changes to <a href="http://pixelated-dreams.com/">Davey Shafik's</a> <a href="http://pear.crtx.org/index.php?package=Crtx_PEAR_Channel_Frontend&amp;release=0.3.1&amp;downloads">Crtx_PEAR_Channel_Frontend</a>.  The code's great and provides a good jumping off point, but I thought it needed some updates.  Davey's been a busy guy and I had a few free hours every other evening or so for a few, so I decided to start extending it.</p>

<p>The first area I wanted to change was some of the text within the frontend.  This was a problem since the Crtx version hard codes all of the display.  I wanted it to be templated with the ability to provide a directory full of overrides so my custom versions could be used.  As I started playing around with it, I found that most of the data I needed access to was only retrieved within the methods I needed to override to change the display.  The method I started with, <code>showPackage()</code>, created the data structure for the package and displayed it all at the same time so I needed to break that out.  The result was Model representations of all of the tables I needed.</p>

<p>With a few final hours today, I finished up the code and started packaging it when I realized I really had two packages; thus, <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/index.php?package=Domain51_PEAR_Channel">Domain51_PEAR_Channel</a> and <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/index.php?package=Domain51_PEAR_Channel_Frontend">Domain51_PEAR_Channel_Frontend</a> were born.  </p>

<p>Domain51_PEAR_Channel gives you access to the tables that the <a href="http://pear.chiaraquartet.net/index.php?package=Chiara_PEAR_Server">Chiara_PEAR_Server</a> creates.  Its still missing a few tables, but the basics are all there.  I've also put together a pretty nice extension system too.  Instead of just having "package_extras", you can define other objects that handle requests to certain properties, then those objects can go wherever they need to to handle retrieving them.  My thought is to eventually extend this out to all of the objects.  That would allow extending out developer's information, put more info on the channels, whatever.  This will require some reworking of the Chiara_PEAR_Server UI in order to handle displaying of the fields, however.</p>

<p>The Frontend code is still very much a work in progress, but I'm throwing it out there to see what people think of it.  Right now, it sort of cheats by extending Crtx_PEAR_Channel_Frontend to provide 99% of the functionality.  In its current state, it only overrides <code>showPackage()</code>.  No particular reason; that's just where I started.  As time permits, it'll take on more and more of the responsibility from Crtx to the point that it doesn't need to extend it (hopefully).</p>

<p>Does anyone else find this useful, or am I the only one who plays around with their PEAR server trying to make it look pretty? :-)  </p>

<p>One other thing, does anyone know why the <code>releases.deps</code> column is stored as a serialized array?  I've got an email in to Greg on it, so hopefully I'll have an answer before too long, but in playing with the internals of the PEAR server that just seemed hackish to me.  By not adding a releases_dependencies table, there's no way to determine what packages require any given package/version combination without some major voodoo regex'ing or grabbing every release, unserializing the deps column, and running through all of the dependencies looking to see if Some_Package was required anywhere.</p>

        <title>Dog parks and Harry Potter</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/07/20/dog_parks_and_harry_potter/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/07/20/dog_parks_and_harry_potter</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We took Remus to the dog park last night for the first time and he had a blast.  Remus, being a big <em>puppy</em> at more than 70 pounds, loves to stretch his legs and play.  Last night, not only did he get to get out and play, but he got to play with some other dogs too.  It seemed like every time I turned around he was either in the middle of the pack playing or off by himself sniffing around.  One or the other, but never somewhere in between.</p>

<p>There was one Rhodesian ridgeback intent on making sure he was the alpha dog at the park, in good fun though.  All of the other dogs were content to let him claim that title, except Remus.  The two of them played around for a good 5 minutes before Remus lost interest.  It ended when Remus was getting a drink of water and Ridgy (as we'll call him) came over to the same bowl.  I could tell by his body language he was spoiling for something, but Remus, being the laid back stoner-pup that he is was just "oh... here let me scoot over a bit so you can get a drink <em>too</em>".  Didn't get out of his way, but didn't block him either.  After that, Ridgy seemed to realize that an acre and a half was enough room for both of 'em.</p>

<p>The funniest, though not really, episode of the night was the big rottweiler.  He just lumbered around, not paying much attention to anyone, doing his own thing.  That is, until a kid on a bike started riding around outside the park.  That dog could move...  200 yards down one side along the fence, stop, and wait for the kid to catch up.  The kid goes back, same thing.  Having been on the receiving end of more than one rott's interest when he wasn't safely enclosed in a dog park, I understand that it's not all of that fun, but still to see that huge lumbering dog come to life.  It looked to me like the owner needed to channel that energy into some bike rides with him.</p>

<p>In case you've managed to miss it, tonight is the final Harry Potter release.  I'm actually pretty excited having been a fan of the series for a few years now.  I will be among the crazies tonight heading out for my copy at midnight and plan on reading the book over the weekend.  I've been formulating what should happen for awhile, and I've honed a theme that might require that I write an alternate book 7 if JK Rowling doesn't follow it.  I'm going to post it here so if I am right it's not an after the fact posting.  If Potter books don't interest you, you can stop reading now...</p>

<p>Still with me?  Ok.  There have been two continual themes throughout the book.  Love and friendship.  As the book's universe started turning dark in book 4, one of the main phrases Dumbledore's speak at the end of Goblet of Fire is to the effect: as we enter these dark and difficult times that lie ahead, the bonds of friendship will be even more important.  As we found out in that book, it was love that saved Harry in the original attack when he was a baby, I think it will be love that saves him again.</p>

<p>Here's the twist, the love has to be a different type.  Voldemort has the blood of Harry Potter inside him now, so the protection offered by his mother's love has been weakened.  It was the unconditional love of blood that saved him; it will be the unrequired love of friendship that saves him now.  Love of family is not a choice.  Laying down your life in exchange for that of a family member is something you would just do.  Love of a friend is a choice.  To feel so much compassion for another, with whom you share no tie other than the your own choice, that you would lay your life down for them is a much more powerful "magic".</p>

<p>In the 6th book, Dumbledore does all he can to save a certain silvery blond boy; including saving him from committing murder to keep his soul pure.  Book 6 spends a lot of time talking about how the soul is torn in two when a murder is committed, so I think there was a specific reason to keep Malfoy from murdering.  That reason, in my estimation, is that Malfoy will realize the error of his ways and make the choice to save Harry, thus protecting Harry with an even more powerful magic.</p>

<p>As in the first meeting of Harry and Voldemort some 16 years prior in the book's timeline, Harry will be reduced to nothing.  Defenseless and alone, after Voldemort has killed the people who attempt to protect him.  Two in my estimation, and two who are for all intensive purposes Deatheaters at the end of book 6.  Voldemort will commit the error or arrogance again, as he admitted that he did in their first meeting.  Blinded by his power, his apparent triumph, he will attempt to kill Harry once more, and once more will meet his downfall at the hands of "old magic".</p>

<p>If I'm wrong, I'll be disappointed.  Possibly not; she could have a better way of tying up the story.  To me, to tie two central themes into one, to tie those together with the theme of love is more powerful than hate, good, more powerful than evil,  and tie them all back to the first chapter of the first book is poetic balance.  We'll see.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know, I know.  I'm still alive for those of you (what, one, two maybe?) that use this blog to make sure I haven't fallen off of a mountain, been run over by a semi, or unwittingly referred to as an "also among the dead" of some hippie's terrorist attack on <a href="http://www.macyscoffee.net/">Macy's</a>.  That said, I've decided I should summer in Phoenix to avoid tourist season up here.  It's becoming a major pain.  Restaurants are packed on the weekends; and not just the Applebee's, I'm talking the local joints that you should have to show a membership ID card to get into.</p>

<p>/end rant</p>

<p>I haven't ridden anything but a single speed rigid now for going on six weeks.  It's starting to grow on me.  I've only done one major climb, went up Eldon Lookout Road about 10:30 in the morning.  I haven't walked that much on a ride in a <em>long</em> time.  I need to start making it back over to the mountain some more so I can get my climbing mojo back, but there's just so much fun stuff over here that's so much closer...  Decisions, decisions...</p>

<p>The Tour's been captivating my mornings recently.  Seen some good races, but the slow-motion sprint this morning was kind of funny.  I guess no one wanted to blow a gasket the day before the mountains start.</p>

<p>The monsoon season's started a bit early this year.  We've had rain of some sort or another every day for a week.  It couldn't have come any sooner.  The <abbr title="National Forest Service">NFS</abbr> had just started floating info that they were going to close the forest the week before the rain started.  They held off, and it looks like we'll make it through this year without a closure short of there being a major fire somewhere around Flagstaff.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's about it from here.  Send some good vibes over <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/default.aspx">Dave's</a> way.  It looks like a couple of months off of the bike due to a busted heel from last week's race.  It's a rough break, but he seems to be taking it in stride.</p>

        <title>New package Phing_d51PearPkg2Task: Extending phing</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/06/27/new_package_phing_d51pearpkg2task_extend/"/>
        <updated>2007-06-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/06/27/new_package_phing_d51pearpkg2task_extend</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I wrapped up a new package called <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/index.php?package=Phing_d51PearPkg2Task">Phing_d51PearPkg2Task</a>.  As the name might suggest, it's a new <a href="http://phing.info">phing</a> task that replaces the existing pearpkg2 task.  I created it because I was - make your sure you're sitting down for this one - turned off by its abstraction.  Everything was done via a mapping or option element and it just seemed rather obscure.</p>

<p>The package still has a long way to go, there's some hard-coded areas that I just took the shortcut on because I was in a "just make it work" mode when I finished it out.  For example, it assumes you're using at least PEAR 1.6.0 and PHP 5.2.3 which shouldn't be a problem for anyone, because we all keep both of PEAR and PHP completely up-to-date... right? :-)  As it stands, this scratches a particular itch that I had; as the itch moves around I'll add more features.</p>

<p>Extending phing is straight forward.  The only real gotcha here is how to name your class.  If you're familiar with PEAR's naming convention, it will make your skin crawl.  They use a Java'esque naming structure in which you load your new task with a &lt;taskdef&gt; call following their Java counterpart, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant's</a> lead.  Assuming you've installed my package, you would load the new task along these lines:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>&lt;taskdef classname="phing.tasks.ext.d51PearPkg2Task" name="d51pearpkg2" /&gt;</code></p></blockquote>

<p>This file is located in your include_path under phing/tasks/ext/d51PearPkg2Task.php.  Using a PEAR naming convention, its class name would have been phing_tasks_ext_d51PearPkg2Task, however, phing also uses the name would be used in Java - albeit there with namespaces - so the class name is d51PearPkg2Task.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the code is quite simple.  You must declare a setter method to handle each attribute.  <code>setBaseInstallDir($base_install_dir)</code> would handle a <code>baseinstalldir</code> attribute.  Likewise, each sub-element must have a create method that returns an object to handle any sub-elements and attributes it might carry.  <code>createLicense()</code> will handle any &lt;license&gt; elements it encounters.</p>

<p>Two other methods are required for tasks, <code>init()</code> and <code>main()</code>.  The former handles any initialization the object might need to do outside of the constructor while the latter is the main entry point that phing calls to actually run the test.  <code>main()</code> is called after all of the attributes and elements have been handled, so all that's left at that point is to actually do what your task is supposed to.</p>

<p>That's all there is to it.  Of course, you can place your phing task wherever you like, so long as it's accessible via the include_path with the dots representing slashes in the path.  With custom tasks, you can do anything with phing you can do with PHP.  Seeing how easy they are to add, it really makes phing a powerful choice for building any sort of project.  Now, I just need to wrap an API to my fridge as a PHP extension so I can add a &lt;bringcoldbeer&gt; task. :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> has decided on namespacing all of their future code.  Hooray!  That means that new PEAR2 code will get along nicely with my code even though we might both have a Testing_Selenium object since theirs will now be PEAR2_Testing_Selenium, and mine is Domain51_Testing_Selenium.  But what if it went further?</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be an amazing triumph of an open source community if all of the different camps came together now and started creating standard interfaces in the main namespace?  Imagine being able to rely on an object that implements HTTP_Request being the same from PEAR2 to Zend to Solar to EZ to Domain51 and Timbucktwo.  It would be an <abbr title="object oriented">OO</abbr> utopia...</p>

<p>Now if a sage programmer I know wasn't so sage...  but he's right.  It's not work the effort of herding cats for what little - if anything - you'd get out of it.  At least there's dreaming...</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: It should be noted that the assumption of PEAR2_ is based on looking at what's happening in the new <a href="http://svn.pear.php.net/repo/">PEAR repository</a> and piecing together conversations on the mailing list.  Greg's right, nothing's official yet, but let's keep our fingers crossed...</p>

        <title>Book Review: The PEAR Installer Manifesto</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Author's Note</em>: This has been posted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPEAR-Installer-Manifesto-Gregory-Beaver%2Fdp%2F1904811191%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dcenter-2%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0PQAZ0M7ETAN2QN3Z7MF%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D1501%26pf%5Frd%5Fp%3D186412001%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3Dhome&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon</a>, where I rated the book four star.</p>

<p>"Isn't PEAR just a bunch of packages you can install?" That's the question you'll receive most of the time if you ask a PHP developer if his software can be installed through the PEAR Installer. There's been a lot of work happening in PEAR that's culminated most recently in the PEAR elections and the announcement of Pyrus - PEAR 2. A major force behind all of these changes, including work on the PEAR Installer, is Greg Beaver. With this book, he can claim "he wrote the book on PEAR". Not that anyone could have disagreed with him before getting this book published. :-)</p>

<p>This past weekend I read through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPEAR-Installer-Manifesto-Gregory-Beaver%2Fdp%2F1904811191%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dcenter-2%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0PQAZ0M7ETAN2QN3Z7MF%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D1501%26pf%5Frd%5Fp%3D186412001%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3Dhome&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">PEAR Installer Manifesto</a>.  For anyone who's not familiar the PEAR installer and how it can be used in projects outside of PEAR, I would point them to this book.  It's only six chapters long, but it walks through the ways to use the PEAR Installer to enhance your projects - large or small, open or closed source, free or pay.  This book covers the basics of what the PEAR Installer is, how to use it to distribute your own packages, and explains how to deploy a website using the installer.  The book closes out with the two chapters that make this book a must read to someone already familiar with the PEAR Installer, but not familiar with what it is capable of: a chapter on PEAR channels and one on embedding the PEAR installer.</p>

<p>A PEAR channel isn't a difficult thing to setup; there are blog posts aplenty on the topic.  This chapter fill in the gaps in those posts answering the &laquo;why&raquo; to how things are done.  I've setup my own channel before, but I hadn't investigated the internals to figure out exactly how everything ticked.  Chapter 5 - Releasing to the World: PEAR Channels, fills in the gaps and gives you a thorough understanding of what makes a channel tick.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 - Embedding the PEAR Installer: Designing a Custom Plug-In System, discusses several methods of handling plug-in systems then demonstrates how to create one using the PEAR Installer as a base.  This chapter really starts to show exactly how powerful the installer can be once you start to re-purpose it, making it more than the command line tool we all use to download and install code.  Thinking of the possibilities this introduced, I actually got giddy.  Yes, I know... I'm a geek.</p>

<p>This is a four star rating, so there were a few things that weren't exactly what I had hoped for.  I hoped this would serve as a full reference to the installer.  While this book takes you a lot of great jumping off points, it doesn't have the thoroughness I wanted.  There are areas where the complexity of the code you're calling isn't covered in depth and you're left with a "this is all you'll need to know for this task" type comment.  It took a visit to Greg's PEAR channel to fully understand how to package a custom file role.  The book demonstrated the required PHP for the role and showed the custom XML, but didn't explicitly state that they were to be packaged together or how they were to be packaged.  An appendix offering an in-depth overview of the code related to the installer would be a great addition to this book.  With the recent news of Pyrus, that might be outdated before it could be ready though.</p>

<p>I would have liked to have seen a more in-depth comparison to competing methods of building/packaging software.  Instead, the only alternative that is discussed at any length is "unzip and go".  It would have been interesting to see the comparison of the PEAR Installer to a traditional build system - such as PHP's phing or Java's Ant &mdash; and to explore using the installer inside a phing/Ant environment and how they could compliment each other.  For example, using phing to handle the build process, while using PEAR channels and the installer to handle distribution and installation.</p>

<p>This book is definitely worth the read for anyone interested in the PEAR Installer and understanding what it is capable of.  The absence of a full reference to the installer code and no mention of viable alternatives to handle packaging are the only things that kept me from rating this book at 5 stars.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... the guy who's going to shank the golf ball.  He's the guy that takes thirty seconds from the time he steps up to the tee to the time he actually hits it.  From my bedroom window, I've got a straight shot of the tee box and can watch these guys get ready.  Without a doubt, if he (or she) sets himself more than once, lifts the golf club head off of the ground and settles it more than once, and/or looks up at the fairway more than once, they're gonna do something wrong.</p>

<p>Ready, aim, fire.  If you have to calm your mind with that much of a routine, you probably shouldn't be playing golf anyhow.  Try something that's less of a mental game, like rock paper, scissors.  :-)</p>

<p>As promised, a bike related post (well, except for the intro).  I've been out three times this week old-school.  I picked up a <a href="http://www.redlinebicycles.com/adultbikes/monocog-29er.html">Monocog 29er</a>.  Full steel, fully rigid (and yes, my engineering friends, I know it's not <em>fully</em> rigid since it has those 29" shock absorbers), singlespeed, and tons of fun.  Literally, tons... it's something like 24 pounds.  The only qualm I have with it is the gearing.  It's got a 20 in the back which is killing me out at places like Campbell Mesa where it's flat.  I think my max speed flat out is something like 15 - 16 mph at close to 120 rpm!</p>

<p>Anyhow, it's great fun.  Kinda different to just hop on and go.  I didn't make it a hundred feet on the first ride before my left thumb instinctively went down to shift into the next gear.  This weekend will hopefully see some singlespeed action, I'm heading out toward Mormon Lake to get some camping in.  I haven't been out to this particular campground, but I'm sure there's something around there to bike on.</p>

<blockquote><p>So the Rails Community has shown what's possible [by raising $33,000 for charity]. Let's not let it stop there. Everyone in our industry is privileged; we're all way better off than the folks being helped by these charities. So let's take this up to the next level. Let's see if we can make all industry conferences into fund raising events.</p></blockquote>

<p>That might actually encourage people - well, me at least - to go to more conferences and would definitely influence my decision on which conferences I did attend.  If given the choice between two conferences with similarly interesting topics and a similar cost, I'd definitely choose the conference that was donating a portion of their profits to charity.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for everyone who voted for me in the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/company/newsroom/press/2007_05_18_0">Komodo contests</a>.  I managed to pull off the win in the extension category and third place in the toolbox category for a grand total of $600 worth of Amazon gift cards and a license for <a href="http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/">Komodo IDE</a> which costs $295.  Not bad for a couple of afternoons worth of playing around with it.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm now at nearly a week with no meat.  I'm doing the veggie thing for awhile.  I've done it before for a little over a month, so it's nothing new.  The big difference is that this time I actually like green leafy vegetables, so it'll probably be a bit easier to come up with things to eat.  I made some burritos last week with soy meat crumbles and had I made them and feed them to you, I seriously doubt you could have told the difference.  That just re-enforced my thought that the majority of meat in my diet is just there for texture - the flavors are coming from other sources.</p>

<p>Riding has been lax lately.  I planned on getting some riding in this weekend, but other events and the weather conspired against me.  Both days were a little on the chilly side with a light misty rain a good part of the day.  Next weekend I'm planning on hitting the mountain Saturday.  Some of the Phoenix crowd is coming up to do a few days of camping and riding.  I've only been over to the mountain a few times this year, so I'm looking forward to some elevation therapy.  I'm thinking that coming down the Catwalk, through the Hobbit Forest, and down Little Bear are musts.  I might have to repent of my lack of riding by heading up to the Eldon Lookout via the road too.  Its sounding like fun... :-)  The last time I spent a few day playing around on the mountain I ended up with something like 5k of climbing (and descending) with only 20 miles of riding.  </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>But I experienced it today.  It really does snow in May!  I couldn't believe it.  This morning I was out and about, and looked out the window and couldn't believe the amount of snow falling!  The temperature (without wind chill) was in the low 40s, so the snow wasn't sticking to anything, but still... weird.</p>

<p>It's been brought to my attention that I haven't blogged enough about bikes recently, yeah I know.  I have got a few decent rides in of late, but for the last week my mountain bike's been out of commission after it decided my last ride was a good time to break the chain three times.</p>

<p>The ride was epic.  I busted out to <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/passages/pass_33.html">Fisher's Point</a> (4.5 miles from the house, only 2 of that being paved), then went south on the <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/">AZ Trail</a>.  It starts off all mellow and fun.  Then turns up.  Then turns around and up again.  And then it does it another time!  I thought I'd seen rocks when I lived in <abbr title=">El Paso">EP</abbr>.  Some of it was really awesome, other parts kept me thinking "why isn't the trail there?".  It's a lot of fall line stuff though and some old jeep roads, so it'll probably get so rutted they'll have to move it... we can only hope. :-)</p>

<p>I followed the trail out to <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/mormon_lake/marshall-lake-boat.shtml">Marshall Lake</a>, then started around the lake.  The western side is mostly just a trail with no (or at least there's supposed to be no) motorized traffic.  As I got to the back side, I came around the corner to be greated by two huge rigor mortis laden Elk legs sticking out from under a pile of rocks.  Talk about a double take.  There was no flesh left and parts of the hide were starting to disappear, so I imagine it was from last fall sometime.  I don't know how it ended up in that state.  It didn't appear that it had been killed for meet as the legs were still in tack.  I couldn't see where the head was supposed to be, but I'm assuming since it wasn't sticking out of the top of this "tomb" it wasn't there any longer.  Might have just been a trophy kill and someone stumbled across it and felt bad that it hadn't had a proper funeral.  Trophy kills like that annoy the crap out of me, but oh well...</p>

<p>When I got to the lake, I had 12.5 miles on the GPS; when I finished circumambulating the lake I was at nearly 18.  Nice size little pond there.  Since the water is way down right now, it looks more like a marsh than a lake, but there were quite a few people out fishing and several seemed to be catching things.</p>

<p>The ride back was pretty tame.  Some of the stuff I'd had to walk up was almost sketchier on the downhill.  Big loose rocks, water bars at funny angles, and the worst, a little tree with dreams of becoming a javelin hiding around one of the corners on a jeep road.  By the time I realized it was there, all I could do was get my face out of the way.  It still caught my arm and I ended up with a nice bruise (that's still there over a week later) and some scratches.  It was unceremoniously "redeposited" to save future hikers the same fate.</p>

<p>I was doing good and made it back to the bottom of the Fisher Point climb around 5.  15 - 20 minutes up the climb, taking my time, and it's all coasting from there.  The first 20 feet into the climb and boom.  There goes the chain for the second time (it broke the first time during the one of the ridable sections of the day's first climbs).  I fiddle with it and get it fixed and start off taking it easy.  I even hopped off a few times where the grade kicked up to keep from putting any undo strain on the chain.  Now it has two stiff links after all.</p>

<p>I make it up to the last section of the trail - literally another 300 - 400 yards and I'm at the top and it goes again.  At this point, I'm 15 minutes from the top by foot and then a flat/down'ish trail the rest of the way home.  I'm tired of fixing chains so I hoof it.  One of the few times I've walked a bike off of the trails.  Another that comes to mind being a fun experience in bike tossing at Cloudcroft... :-)</p>

<p>I ended up with a touch over 30 miles for the day and 2:50 pedaling with another 30 - 40 minutes pushing.  It was a gorgeous day; in the mid 70s.  Very unlike today's gloomy 40s and snow/sleet/rain combination.  Oh well, at least the days like this make it that much more unlikely that we'll have the forest closed this summer.</p>

        <updated>2007-05-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/05/03/with_friends_like_these</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I proposed my first PEAR package.  I've helped a few friends with packages of their own, but never got around to getting a developer account and taking the lead on a package.  After hearing about the recent changes in store and the umpteenth "you should propose that" from <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a>, I decided to propose one of the smaller "packages" I've used in some of my code: <a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=482">PHP_Callback</a>.  I say packages with quotation marks because it's really just one, simple file.</p>

<p>The main goal of this is to wrap the callback pseudo-type in PHP into something that's more manageable.  As it currently stands, you have to do <a href="http://php.net/is-callable">is_callable()</a> on a variable to determine whether you can call it without an error.  PHP_Callback performs that check and throws an exception if you try to instantiate it with an invalid callback.  It also allows you to store parameters to be used by the callback repeatedly which is useful for setting up a callback and just passing it off to other objects and have them get back exactly what you want to give them.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the proposal went live yesterday.  The first two comments (note it's an international list, so that's the reason for the slightly broken English):</p>

<blockquote><p>This is useless. PHP callbacks are already quite comprehensible and don't need to be complicated.</p></blockquote>

<p>And... </p>

<blockquote><p>A proper way to use callbacks in OO code is to implement something like Command pattern, not create a useless wrapper around call_user_func().</p></blockquote>

<p>And as I write this, this just came in:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think it's not needed.... there is quite a comprehensible callback mechanism in PHP and I don't think we need such a pure OO class in the repository just to fit all design patterns. It's just confusing and not needed, as this pattern is more needed by strict OO languages.</p>

<p>Maybe someone needs such a class, but it's too easy to implement as there is a own PEAR package needed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow.  That's all I can think of.  I'm actually surprised I haven't gotten a "PHP is not Java" comment yet.  Why is there such a resistance to <abbr title="object oriented">OO</abbr> code from the most vocal PHP'ers?</p>

<p>As for the actual comments.  To the first one I would say, so type hinting isn't necessary at all?  To the second, you didn't read my code as I didn't use <code>call_user_func()</code>, but instead used <code>call_user_func_array()</code> ;-)  The third borders on ridiculous.  Because something is easy to implement is reason enough for it to be excluded from a standard library?  "So since 'echo' is easy to implement, let's leave it out of shells."</p>

<p>Again, wow.  The reason I unsubscribed from pear-dev several years ago is just those types of comments.  It was a pain to filter through them to get to the worthwhile content.  This is a simple package.  One most new-to-PHP programmers could have put together in an afternoon.  I can only imagine how quickly a new developer would have unsubscribed from pear-dev and pulled his proposal if his first foray into contributing to the community had been met so quickly with such unconstructive criticism.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent this past weekend in Kansas City visiting my <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/">parents</a> and hanging out for <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">my nephew's</a> 2nd birthday.  It was great to be out there, see everyone, catch up, see the new houses, see my nephew who I haven't seen since he was 8 months old; but it's good to be back home.  Last night was a killer flight.  I picked a late flight so we could hang out most of the day Sunday.  I figured the drive from <a href="http://phoenix.gov/AVIATION/">PHX</a> wouldn't be too bad and I'd be fast asleep by 1 at the latest.  Nope...</p>

<p>I showed up at the airport an hour and a half before my flight took off.  <a href="http://www.flykci.com/">MCI</a> isn't a very busy airport, so you can practically show up 30 minutes before a flight and still get through security.  When I got there, the flight was delayed 15 minutes.  No biggy.  After grabbing a soda from $tarbucks I went through security with around an hour before boarding.  The thing you have to know about MCI is that once you're through security, you're their's.  No food (except a kiosk that closes at 9), no water fountains, and <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/042207_21141.jpg.html">not nearly enough seats</a>.</p>

<p>After hanging out for 15 minutes or so we get the "I hate to be the barer of bad news, but..." speech.  The flight was now shooting for a 10:40 departure instead of 9:15.  Great.  We didn't start boarding the plane until 10:45, and it was at least 11:10 before we pushed off.  I'm cranky, my blood sugar's all off, and I'm tired.  Well, at least I'll grab a pillow and catch a cat nap before I drive back up to Flagstaff.  Nope.  They've got maybe a 70% full plane; the plane's been sitting at the gate for nearly an hour and a half; and somehow it didn't dawn on them that a flight that was leaving at 11 PM would need to have a few pillows!  Seriously, I'm maybe the 30th person to get on the plane and the crew announces that they're out of pillows and blankets and that if anyone has more than one and wants to share, to please pass it back out to the aisle.  Umm... excuse me?</p>

<p>So, that's it.  I'm done with Southwest if I can at all help it.  The lack of assigned seating, the "we're only delaying 15 minutes, even though your crew hasn't left the ground in the other city yet" lying through their teeth to keep me from canceling my ticket and walking over to one of their competitors that does get their planes off of the ground on time, and the inability to forecast the needs of their customers, like, you know... needing pillows on a 3 hour flight at 11 PM!  Seriously?  Is it that hard to figure out?</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/04/23/getting_re_started_in_c_for_php</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been reading through Sara Golemon's excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FExtending-Embedding-PHP-Developers-Library%2Fdp%2F067232704X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1177388886%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Extending and Embedding PHP</a>.  I'm about half way through the book and I've already been able to do a completely useless, but functional extension for PHP.</p>

<p>In the vein of <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=236">theoritical limits</a> of PHP's parsed code versus compiled code, I put together a simple hello world app and hit <abbr title="Apache Benchmark">AB</abbr> up against it to see what it could handle.  They both outputted "Hello World!\n" via a function call.  The result on a basic function, with no parameter, and no return is roughly a 6% gain in speed.  </p>

<p>What was interesting was running procedural code.  Doing a straight '&lt;?php echo "Hello World!\n"; ?&gt;' in the file was actually faster to parse than using a compiled hello_world() function.  I was kind of surprised with that one.</p>

<p>But since procedural code is not as maintainable as compiled functions and objects and you get a speed boost from compiling, I'm thinking that might be an interesting way to handle a PHP framework (and one that I don't think has been done yet).  PHP is still the place to do experiments, but once you've got the API locked down, I'm thinking making an extension out of that code would get you some great speed benefits.  According to my thought process, things like parsing URLs, parsing code for reflection, etc., etc., should go much faster in compiled code.  I guess the next step here is to create a Hello_World object and test it out - now just to get to that part of the book.  :-)</p>

<p>One question I do have for any PHP'ers out there, do you have any recommendations on C books?  I'm leaning toward either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProgramming-C-3rd-Developers-Library%2Fdp%2F0672326663%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1177389707%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Programming in C</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FC-Programming-Language-2nd%2Fdp%2F0131103628%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1177389771%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The C Programming Language</a>.  The former is simply because of the publisher.  I've yet to be disappointed by a book published from the Developer's Library (Sara's and George's books included); the latter I flipped through at the bookstore over the weekend and it seemed like a pretty decent book.  I know enough C to make things work, but right now it's a matter of trial and error to get some things working.  If I'm going to take full advantage of the speed to be gained by a PHP extension, I'll need to have a better fundamental understanding of the language and how it works.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... but instead I get to wait around for another hour and a half.  Yipee!  I started to call <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> and see if he wanted to grab a beer at the airport tonight, but decided against it since I only had an hour between flights.  Ends up now that there's 4 hours between the time I landed and the time I <em>should</em> take off.</p>

<p>Well, this gives me a chance to update everyone on the <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/">Dawn 'til Dusk</a> this past weekend.  I spent the entire week with a stomach bug, and I seriously considered bailing on Jens Saturday morning.  Having been on the loosing end of that deal last year, I decided to tough it out and see what I could pull off.  Jens took two pulls to start the race, then we started swapping.</p>

<p>First lap on I pushed, but kept a pace I felt I could keep pretty well throughout the day if I kept fueled.  Turned in an 1:11 lap.  Sweet, a minute and a half faster than my fastest last year.  Jens pulled another sub 1:10 lap, I went out for the next one.  My first lap the middle ring had started acting up pretty bad, so this lap I decided it's all in the big ring or little ring.  Made the climbs a little slower because I couldn't grind 'em out in the middle ring, but I kept in the big as much as I could.  Turned in a sub 1:10 lap.  I'm feeling good now...</p>

<p>I go out for my third lap after another hour off of the bike, and now I'm feeling it.  Mojo's still there, but this isn't feeling as good as the last lap.  My time shows it with a lap around 1:14.  I'm still feeling good 'cause that's just a handful of seconds off of my fastest lap last year.  I come in and ask Jens if he's up for two more laps.  Yup, he is and off he goes.  I need to get some food in my stomach and give it time to digest.  He comes rocking in with yet another sub 1:10 lap, and a minute later shows up at the tent "hey, why aren't you up there?"  Crap...</p>

<p>I had asked if he was up for another two laps, not another two consecutive laps.  Just a miscommunication.  We ended up loosing a couple of minutes as we get water bottles swapped out, more gu, and off he goes.  I hit the next lap ready to rock.  My legs are feeling it on the climbs still, but as soon as it levels out a bit (or at least drops below sustained 10% grades) I'm hitting the groove.  Not many people on the trails now, but I'm picking 'em off like mad (except for a Health FX rider and one other guy I didn't recognize).  I come around a corner to a guy relieving himself and he asks the time.  A few minutes later he's pushing me.  It's one of the Gallup guys, and I'm not sure, but I think he's rolling duo as I've seen him out a lot that day.  I turn it up.  I'm not cramping, but I know I go too much more I'm going to be there.  My tach is sitting right on the red line.</p>

<p>He's rolling it with me.  Sweet, we've got a race for place going on after 11 hours of racing.  This is what ultra enduros (or as <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/">Dave Harris</a> would call 'em, just a nice little tune up race) is all about.  Pushing yourself as much as you can, and then finding a little more when it comes to the - drum roll please...  can't you see this coming? - eleventh hour.  What a pun ;-)</p>

<p>Anyhow, he sticks with me for another 5 minutes or so.  As we hit the turn around and start heading back, he's still with me.  It's a slight climb and I'm turning a 44 by 28/26 climbing out a 2%'ish grade.  Nice and gradual with just enough rollers to keep the momentum going with the big wheels.  By the time I make it to the next connector, my mark is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>I rolled it in, broke camp and hit the road.  Didn't want to be midnight getting home.  Turns out Jens and I finished 8th out of 30 some teams.  A little disappointing.  Would have liked to at least be top 5, but I was turning in some slower laps than I would have liked and the guys on top were turning in sub-hour laps.  We ended up less than two minutes off of 7th, so that sucks that I screwed up that double - probably cost us the place.</p>

<p>All in all, I'm pleased.  I felt like crap in the morning, but my slowest lap was still within a minute and a half of my fastest lap last year.  I also learned something pretty important.  I can rock the big ring a lot more than I give myself credit for.  I have no doubt my laps would have been slower if my middle ring would have been working 'cause I would have been spinning a lower gear all day and only getting into the big ring on the flats and the few downhills.  The way it was, I had to roll the big ring in order to move.  That was cool to find out...  Something I'll definitely have to remember when I'm on the trails from here on out.</p>

<p>Next up - I'm not sure.  There's another 12 hour in the four corners in May.  I might hit that one up, just not sure yet.  We'll see.  Big shout out to <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/">Matt</a> who rocked the <abbr title="Single Speed">SS</abbr> class.  He went out on his 11th lap just to screw with the other guys.  I came on my last lap to see him talking to some of the course marshals.  And he did all of that on a rigid too.  Man's an animal.  Dave Harris pulled a 2nd on a "training" race even after spending 30 minutes or more fiddling with a broken chain in the AM.</p>

<p>One final note, Jens and I pulled 8th in the male duo, but we would have pulled a 2nd in the male four man team category and beat all of the other co-ed and team categories.  That just shows how stiff that competition was.  Hey, if you're gonna get beat, get beat by the best.</p>

<p>Here's the MotionBased data from the race.  My average <abbr title="Heart Rate">HR</abbr> is skewed 'cause of the down time.  Those maxes though are dead on.  My HR was hitting nearly 200 <abbr title="Beats Per Minute">BPM</abbr> on those climbs with the stomach bug.</p>

<p>Err - MB is giving me errors when I attempt to access it.  I'll post it up later in the week.  If you really want to see it now, try <a href="http://tswicegood.motionbased.com/">tswicegood.motionbased.com</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My dad's father - or as he called him, the <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/index.php?title=the_old_man_is_gone&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Old Man</a> - passed away last night.  It's clich&eacute; at this point to say that I felt like I never knew him.  I think that's the standard thing at this point for any grandchild to say.  In this case, I think it's more fitting.</p>

<p>I haven't seen or talked to him - or any of my dad's family for that matter - for over a decade.  Before that, I had only seem him occasionally after I was 6 and my family moved out west.  There was a rift in the family, the details of which I won't bore you with, but it ended with folks basically going their own separate ways.</p>

<p>It's kind of a mixed bag.  I don't really feel a sense of loss because like I said I hardly knew him and he hasn't played any part in my life for over a decade, but I feel for my <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/">Dad</a> because he's got to go through this.  If you have a chance, I'm sure he'd <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/index.php?title=the_old_man_is_gone&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1#comments">appreciate a comment</a>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, off to finish packing for <a href="http://dawntilduskrace.com/">tomorrow's race</a>.  There was snow on the ground here this morning and the chance of it all day today in Gallup, but it's supposed to be in the 60s tomorrow.  I've been fighting some sort of stomach bug all week, so I'm not looking for a stellar performance, but hopefully it's enough to have a respectable placing tomorrow around 7 PM.  Hopefully this year I won't end up solo'ing the second half of the day :-)</p>

        <title>Programming languages are declarative</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why don't people understand this?  I've spent a bit of time today on the <a href="http://www.azphp.org/">AzPHP</a> mailing list offering up reasons as to why inline API documentation is a bad thing (private list, so no link).</p>

<p>Think about it - a programming language is a way to declare what you want the computer to do.  It's that simple.  With a properly written program, all the API docs are doing is hiding the code that tells me exactly what is going on instead of what a programmer once knew - thought in a lot of cases - was going on.  And if your code is so complex, or so convoluted that you <em>have</em> to document it in plain-English just to start to understand it, it's time to start refactoring.</p>

<p>This isn't to say I'm not a fan of documentation.  I just differ from mainstream PHP in what form I <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/pocket_guide/3.0/en/other-uses-for-tests.html#other-uses-for-tests.agile-documentation">look for</a>.  Give me a unit test any day over a three paragraph docblock.   The test provides an assumption, the code to prove it, and an example of how I should actually use your code in - get this - real code.  It's a win-win-win.</p>

<p>Ok - I'll hop off of my soap box now.  Less than 60 hours to go until the pain and torture of this year's <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/">Dawn 'til Dusk</a>.  I'm waking up at night in a cold <strike>sweet</strike> sweat thinking about the two climbs this year.</p>

If you don't believe that the Evangelical movement is the most dangerous movement to plague American - nay, the world - you need to watch this movie.</p>

<p>The preparation for "God's Army"; the amount of "fight for America" talk; the targeting of children as a means of saving America, returning it to it's true status as a nation of God, as a Christian nation... it is terrifying.</p>

<p>This documents the Evangelical's answer to the madrasah - it's every bit as scary.</p>

<p>To my non-American readers, please know that this is a fringe group.  This in no way represents the majority of Americans.  Most of us - at least I still hold out hope - still have a grip on reality.</p>

My favorite quote is in the final item of the code, <em>We ignore the trolls</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty, but the pig likes it.</p></blockquote>

<p>On to something more on topic - went to Gallup yesterday to pre-ride the course with <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/">Matt</a> and Yens.  Did two laps and they were around what I expected - sub 1:30 just putzing around.  This year though, they've got a nasty surprise in store for everyone.  They've reversed the course.  Remember those two crazy descents from last year toward the end of the lap?  The one that was steep and the one off of the rock face.  Yeah, we're climbing those puppies.  My guess is that there'll be a lot of pushing once you get past hour 6 or 7.  I feel for the <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/">crazy people</a> who think <abbr title="Single Speed">SS</abbr> is a good idea for this course. :-)</p>

<p>It's amazing the number of sites with bad usability if you have images turned off (say you're blind and you have some sort of browser reader reading the site's content for you).  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">WhiteHouse.gov</a> is my favorite.  Should be the most accessible site online, but nope.</p>

<p>Anyhow, happy <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">Naked Day</a> to ya...</p>

        <title>MTS 07 - PowerShell Basics</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/03/28/mts_07_powershell_basics/"/>
        <updated>2007-03-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/03/28/mts_07_powershell_basics</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jim Truher, Product Manager of PowerShell.</p>

<p>MS has a new shell called PowerShell.  There's new CLI tools, a scripting language, C# can be written interactively in the shell a la console.</p>

<p>They've redefined the text paradigm to an object-based one.  Or that's the contention at the start.  Their smaller commands are called "Cmdlets" (pronounced Commandlets).  As Jim says it, it sounds like "our commandments" :-)</p>

<p>The definition of a cmdlet is a built-in function (cd, cat, etc.) in bash.  They can be built in C# and then compiled into an installable cmdlets.  Argument handling is built-in through some sort annotation style mark-up.  Definitely a nice addition for anyone who's written a CLI script.</p>

<p>It now allows the basic type shell usage.  His shell is setup to mimic a *nix shell with aliases to `ls`, etc.</p>

<p>The geeky stuff in this is code that does things like:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>PS>$a = get-ipconfig;<br />
PS>$a[0].hostname<br />
travis-laptop</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Anything you can do with C# you can do in the powershell.  It's definitely a nice paradigm.  It'll allow you to store custom objects in addition to the built-ins.  You can't share objects between PS sessions directly, though you could serialize them and share them for data, but the actual object and methods won't exist there.</p>

<p>They don't allow you a su type command to elevate privileges which seems kind of weird.  I'm not the only one that thinks that way either.</p>

<p>I think the presentation has elevated the geek status of all of us.  The fact that we've had a ton of questions about shell access - I mean, wow. :-)</p>

<p>This does seem interesting and is something I'll probably have to install on my XP install and see how it works.  Jim's talking about the target audience: guys from *nix backgrounds that get frustrated in Windows cause it's so hard to make it do what you want - i.e., the guys like me that install Cgywin. :-)  If they're really interested in tackling that market, they'll try to do it port it to the *nix platform so it can be used there in place of bash/sh/etc.</p>

<p>Of all of the things I've seen so far, this one is the best in terms of advances by Microsoft compared to where their shells have been.  Jim was asked about porting PS to another platform, and he didn't see it as something they'd focus on.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Jim was asked about porting it to *nix and didn't see that as something Microsoft would invest the time in.  Every person I talked to after the fact seemed to agree that porting <abbr title="PowerShell">PS</abbr> to *nix was a certain way to remove the "I can't do anything in Windows" barrier for sys-admins.  Having a shell that's as powerful as this available to install on <abbr title="Red Hat Enterprise">RHEL</abbr> or Ubuntu would get some uptake which gets people using the same tool they can use on Windows.  That also starts programmers down the .NET road as they start using the C# that's available to them on the command-line and then scripts turn into programs and new .NET programmers are born.</p>

<p>Seems like they'd be shooting themselves in the foot to not attempt a port.</p>

<p>XNA - the marketing term for "Next generation game development platform for PC and XBox 360".  The "running joke is XNA is Not an Acronym".</p>

<p>He's going through a history of gaming langauges starting with the ASM guys back in the day saying that C++ required too much memory to work and then the C++ guys saying .NET wouldn't work.  Could you imagine what would happen if they went back to ASM with modern hardware?  It's be freaky kind of fast!</p>

<p>Just miscellaneous stuff - I'm tired, but I finally got rid of the headache around noon after I scored a few Advil from Tanya.  They're giving all of us a year's subscription to MSDN to have access to their programs.</p>

<p>He's going through some XBox Live stuff.  They have downloadable games, things like that.  Sort of like a console version of what you've been able to do with your phone for half a decade.</p>

<p>XNA is going to be available as a subscription service.  $99/year gets you the license you need to create games.  The "Creator's Club" is required to develop and use the XNA games.</p>

<p>The Xbox .NET framework is based off of the mobile device framework.</p>

<p>"That has never happened... " :-)</p>

<p>They have the .NET Micro Framework which covers small devices (watches, etc.) that work on under 300k.  Windows Embedded which works on a larger devices and is broken down into three parts.  Windows Mobile is built on top of Windows CE (one of the Embedded packages).</p>

<p>They've had a hands-on demo with a bunch of mobile devices.  I managed to kill one in bluetooth - it hung while searching for other devices.</p>

<p>As far as development goes - the usual suspects.  Flash, Java, AJAX via Pocket IE, etc.  Some of the live demos included things like "Women grows nipple on feet" and something about jesuit priests and sex.</p>

<p>The best quote: "Umm... I guess I should sanitize my demo a little bit." :-)</p>

<p>This is the second presentation that's had "there's more things coming, but I can't tell you yet."  Sounds like they haven't got the timing thing down yet.</p>

<p>He's got three slides, then the "Beat Up Pete" session where we get to ask questions.  First one up I hope - When do IE drop it's own engine and start implementing on top of Gecko?</p>

<p>They've got 500 million IE users worldwide and they're worried about changes affecting them.  ie.Next is the tool - IE8 or whatever comes next.  They are starting to plan it now.</p>

<p>Pete.LePage@<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/">http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/</a><br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/</a></p>

<p>Things people want to see in the next IE:</p>
<ul><li>improved support for media formats (vorbis, etc.)</li>
<li>Cavnas object</li>
<li>Extensions that are easier to work with (think XPI)</li>
<li>Inline search/search-as-you-type</li></ul>

<p>Got the answer I expected on removing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)">Trident</a> from IE.  "If you replace rendering, what about javascript; then javascript, what next?"  It's too coupled with the Windows experience to start pulling it out.  I understand it from a company control standpoint, but I don't know if it's necessarily one I agree with.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One point I didn't make which actually didn't occur to me until after I started thinking on the "why" of dropping Gecko in the back-end.  The whole hindsight's 20/20, etc.  Anyhow, the point is that the actual rendering is the one thing we can't programmatically handle.  Javascript we <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">can</a> <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">and</a> <a href="http://mootools.net/">have</a> overcome, but CSS can't be handled without ugly hacks that might or might not work in ie.Next.</p>

<p>Gecko might not be the answer, but having a third-party rendering engine that can be used by anyone without licensing/<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> concerns would be extremely useful to developers.</p>

<p>He's covering WPF and WPF/E.  He's running the first non-Vista laptop.  Very important for you guys to know that :-)</p>

<p>He's using MS Expression Blend to build the WPF's.  It currently works for desktop apps.  It's a visual IDE much like Flash.  Has some neat features, but then I haven't kept up with this type of "development" as I don't do it.</p>

<p>One of the cool features is being able to search through a toolbar and filter the tools that are shown so you don't have to search through everything if you don't know where it's at.  </p>

<p>This type of environment in JS would be useful for doing Canvas animation and such in FF.</p>

<p>He just demoed a cool photo book that had really good virtual photo book.  Also, the Blend environment will allow you to resize the entire environment which is very cool.  <a href="http://galbraiths.org/blog/">Ben has some cool photos</a> on his recap.</p>

<p>WPF/E brings the WPF environment onto the web.  Things like vector drawing, 3d animations, etc., are possible.  3d isn't native in WPF/E, but it is possible.  Had some tubes floating, a rubix cube, etc.  Also had the photo book online.</p>

<p>The code that makes it work online is working in IE, FF, and Safari.</p>

<p>He's mentioned <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> quite a bit.  They have property in Second Life for evangelism and had a Vista launch there.</p>

<p>Best quote: "I won't argue that we've made your life harder, but we did it for the right reasons."</p>

<p>From Duncan Buell: "Make so Ben's mother can install it" :-)  He apparently tells his students to document their code to the point that their mother can understand what it's doing.</p>

<p>One of his contentions is that users will drive technology instead of technology driving users.  Based on what I've seen in apps in the PHP community, he is correct.  phpBB's success can only be explained by a user driven model.  WordPress was not the best blog software (some would still argue that it still isn't) for a long time, but it filled the explicit need people had.</p>

<p>A stat he threw out - 2 million people around the world identify themselves as "professional coders" while over 100 million identify themselves as "non-professional coders".</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Michael Howard the Security Guy - mikehow@</p>

<p>Good quote: "The problem with that... aside from the lawsuits." :-)</p>

<p>He's spent the first few minutes talking about security as requiring a pragmatist's mindset.  Essentially, you can't secure everything and if you could you couldn't use it.</p>

<p>"Everyone has security problems...  You're either going to do something about it or nothing."</p>

<p>"Reliability is dead easy.  It's man versus machine.  Security is man versus man."</p>

<p>On the <abbr title="Security Development Lifecycle">SDL</abbr>: "Spin it a spiral, send it down a waterfall, or slap Agile on it..." :-)  </p>

<p>Security Training is required for new hires.  A question from the gallery was can an <abbr title="Independent Software Vendor">ISV</abbr> take the class.  Mike's response was "if you sign the <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreement">NDA</abbr>, sure.  I wouldn't have a problem with anyone in this room taking the class."</p>

<p>Threat Modeling is all about design issues.  It's looking at design prior to implementation to see what possible security risks it has.</p>

<p>This guy's got great quotes.  "I heard a pundit say that this industry will only get better when we have better tools.  No.  This industry will only get better when we don't have monkeys programming."</p>

<p>He's a firm believer that tools help, but they're not the end-all.  Couldn't have said it better myself.  One tool they do use extensively is check-in policies.</p>

<p><abbr title="Standard Annotation Language">SAL</abbr> - the Standard Annotation Language.  It's using annotations for checking latter in testing and security.  The idea is that if you annotate the header files and the tools start reflecting information from it while testing.  Kind of an interesting way to handle testing.</p>

<p>Just thinking out loud here...  You could write code to do something like:</p>

<p><code>/**<br />
 * @assertEquals this(2, 2), 4<br />
 */</code></p>

<p>Then the testing framework can build its tests based on the inflection.  Might be interesting.</p>

<p>In order to add things to the SDL it has to demonstrate that it could have prevented 5 bugs.</p>

<p>His blog is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard">blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard</a>.</p>

<p>He made the assertion that Apache is getting worse with their bug introduction.  And that it's the most hacked server on the Internet.  Personally, I think that's disingenuous as it's also the most prevalent server on the Internet.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.JoeOn.net">Joe Stagner</a> - Joe.Stagner@</p>

<p>He's focusing mostly on Atlas and AJAX.  He thinks the current AJAX is kind of naive in that it's mostly eye-candy.  Couldn't agree more.</p>

<p>They're focusing on powering business.  Using AJAX (which he's including web services or Web 2.0 in) to intercept VoIP calls, grab the phone number, do look-ups, when an order is placed on that call, print out a picture of the building, routing drivers, etc., etc., all behind the scenes to the person answering the call.</p>

<p>He's spending a lot of time namespacing in JS.  All of the AJAX stack is namespaced with their Client Library.  They apparently have their own namespace style which I'm not sure why they need.  All you have to do is "<code>var MS = {};</code>", then away you go.</p>

<p>They've got some new stuff in the work that makes multi-domain JS possible.  Sounds like a security nightmare.</p>

<p>His gym's webserver is running PHP. :-)</p>

<p>They're generating JS from web service files based on the ASP.NET code.  Seems like what we're doing with PHP all of the time.  The one difference is that they completely translate from the server-side to full native JS.  So you return an object that implements the Iterator in PHP and the MS code creates that full object in JS that you can iterate through without calling back to the server for each new list.</p>

<p>That's very similar to something I've been talking to <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> about regarding duplicating the PHP environment in JS to have fully rich apps with an MVC model in JS.</p>

<p>"The biggest problem is that IE6 is the largest browser..."  Taken slightly out of context. ;-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IIS7 guys look like they've taken a few notes out of the Apache book.  It's much easier to do a lightweight IIS7 install due to a bunch of modularity they've introduced.</p>

<p>This is the first talk that they've shown some code.  One of the devs is going to be creating an IIS7 module.  40 lines of C# code is all it took.  Interesting.  There is overhead in the loading of the "Managed Modules" as opposed to their "Native" ones which are C/C++.</p>

<p>All of the configs are logs are XML.  Through configs you can swap out modules, lock your settings, etc.  The UI for admin is still in place, but the config behind it works on XML.  Carlos: "Inet Manager is just the fanciest XML editor ever."</p>

<p>They've added the equivalent of environment variables in to IIS7.  Makes storing variables inside a config file easier.  It supports encryption via a command line tool 'appcmd'.</p>

<p>Straight CGI mode gets 24/reqs per second on <a href="http://qdig.sourceforge.net">Qdig</a>.  Using FastCGI he's getting 58 to 59/reqs per second.  </p>

<p>They have internal caching for PHP that'll detect file changes and cache results - it got 7942 straight away and 86xx on the second reload.  Wow... That's like serving static HTML.  When we get to the Q&amp;A - I'll ask about the baseline for static content.</p>

<p>They have a much better user authentication system, but it didn't work.  He got all the way through it, but it wouldn't take his password. :-)</p>

<p>As the whole inetmngr code is built upon schemas and XML and can be expanded with .NET code.  It actually reminds me a lot of XUL <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/tutorials/xultu/overlay.html">overlays</a>.  The whole configuration is done via HTTPS, so you can use the GUI for remote management.</p>

<p>Currently, it's only available on Vista and will be on Longhorn, but isn't going to be available for older (i.e., Win2003) servers.</p>

<p>About the caching - you can use kernel mode caching and get roughly the same throughput.  Definitely interesting for things such as dynamic CSS and JS generated in PHP.  Sounds similar to the Zend Platform caching.</p>

        <title>MTS07 - The first speaker, Bill Hilf</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/03/26/mts07_the_first_speaker/"/>
        <updated>2007-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/03/26/mts07_the_first_speaker</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just stream of consciousness notes during the presentation...</p>

<p>Bill Hilf, General Manager Platform Strategy MS Corp.</p>

<p>Talking mostly about open source software.  He's putting a lot of stress on not being an apologist.  Ouch - bad blue pill joke.  "I guess you could say I took the blue pill and joined IBM".</p>

<p>Microsoft is the "most manically self-critical company" spending 58 minutes of an hour meeting talking about "how we suck".</p>

<p>He constantly is defending the "Linux is un-American" comments and claims them as "the gum on [his] shoes".</p>

<p>The two secrets to Microsoft: Write a piece of software that can run on 100's of millions of hardware, and software that can run 100's of millions of programs using a common API."  Response from the crowd: "that's called Java". :-)</p>

<p>He's really pushing <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com">SugarCRM</a> as a good opensource relationship with MS and open source.</p>

<p>Port 25 is the place to get info on MS opensource.  CodePlex is their OSS portal (i.e., Sourceforge).  CodePlex allows any time of software regardless of license.</p>

<p>"Coopetition..."  Cooperation and Competition.  Must be the internal replacement to Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.  Recommends Blue Ocean Stragety.</p>

<p>"One of the <em>mythologies</em> of open source companies is that it's just about services" (paraphrase).  The idea is to differentiate your product to make money.</p>

<p>Six lessons:</p>

<ol><li>Patience is key</li>
<li>Learn what you can handle</li>
<li>Invest in friends and skilled allies</li>
<li>Identify goals and sitable targets</li>
<li>The right place at the right time (find your own pace)</li>
<li>Use all resources - "Play long, play hard, and use as many sources as you see fit"</li></ol>

<p>All of these are straight out of the strategy book for World of Warcraft.  His email is billhilf@ - if you can't figure out the rest, you shouldn't be reading this :-)</p>

<p>He keeps mentioning SugarCRM and PHP - as two different things.  That's good for Sugar that they've got themselves defined outside of the context of the language.</p>

<p>During the QA:</p>

<p>"I don't care... I don't even know what Java is" - a quote from the head of an ER at one of the local hospitals in Redmond.  That's the lesson, people don't care what technology powers software, so long as it works.</p>

<p>Whats the difference between SF and CodePlex?  SF has to be under an OSI license.  MS wanted to provide a license-agnostic MS community.</p>

<p>Speculation on OSI licensing - would they consider it?  Absolutely, we just have to work it out.  He has a hard time with the ideology of open source separate of the software.  "We don't believe in all of them"...  Guess no GNU/Windows anytime soon... :-)</p>

<p>Thoughts on GPLv3 - "It's hard to talk about GPLv3 because it's constantly in flux."</p>

<p>Why didn't you use the ODF instead of doing your own with OpenXML?  It's not a "save as" text standard.  His claim is that they're different technically in that Microsoft Office uses OpenXML in a different way than serializing data to the disk.</p>

<p>"You want the competition - the VHS versus Betamax, the HDDVD from Blueray."  From the crowd: "Nobody with have a brain will believe that comment coming from you."</p>

<p>Closing Notes:<br />
He was good.  The OpenXML is a touchy issue for sure.  I may expand these once I get more time...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Best quote: "The people who have closed systems have their little kingdoms."</p>

<p>The basics of service-oriented-architecture focus on creating services that are consumed.  Instead of a mapping web site, a service that offers access to mapping data.  Basic web services stuff applied to business services.</p>

<p>Something to read on is <abbr title="Service Markup Language">SML</abbr>.</p>

<p>Interesting presentation, just not a lot of notes.</p>

<p>"General manager of research of everything else...  Things that don't require researchers."</p>

<p>They're working on some cool new computing models.  Cameras and computers that can recognize a "virtual/real" environment that allows you to interact with real environment that is representing a partially virtual environment.  i.e., playing checkers with a half </p>

<p>They found out that the light in the refrigerator does go out using a 'SenseCam' in the frig.  Practical uses include memory aids for people that have problems with memory.  On one patient, there was a 2.5x memory recall over 3 months for someone who couldn't remember longer than one week.</p>

<p>Heat density on Pentium processor is currently hotter than a nuclear reaction and approaching that of a rocket nozzle.  AMD/Intel think that a 5.0Ghz processor is as fast as it'll be able to get.  That's the reason behind multi-core processors.</p>

<p>Capers Jones, Estimating Software Costs, pg. 140<br />
Capers Jones, Patterns of Software Systems Failure &amp; Success</p>

<p>35% of project time spent on debugging.  </p>

<p>"Composability allows us to deal with complexity in a way that  yields orders of magnitude more concurrency."</p>

<p>The focus in the abbreviated Q&amp;A was concurrency and when it'll be available.  Kevin is optimistic, but some in the audience seemed to believe that it wasn't going to happen due to the time/money/energy that had already been put into it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don Box and Chris Anderson.  Don used to be a specialist in HST - Hooking Shit Together.  They started off just asking for questions from the attendees on "how [Microsoft] sucks?" and they'd answer 'em.</p>

<p>Best quote: IE7... Civil Rights... It's all the same... </p>

<p>From the gallery about IE7 - we avoid that which Department of Homeland Security recommends against.  Don's response... "yeah... like civil liberties."</p>

<p>We got an apology from Box for all of the statements that Ballmer makes that scares people. :-)</p>

<p>XAML is for writing shit down - WSD.</p>

<p>"The best thing that happened to Microsoft this decade was Google." from Don.  "Microsoft works best when it has a big, scary competitor."</p>

<p>Talking about MS not being cool and people not wanting to go to work for them now.  Chris said he thinks MS needs a better apprenticeship program.  Ironic that he mentioned that based on my recent thoughts on how there needs to be more craft-style apprenticeships in the dev industry in general to teach the parts of programming that don't come from books.</p>

<p>"Thingification" - turning concepts into things.</p>

<p>This sounds like OpenID.  I'm not sure exactly how it differs.  I asked that question.  The difference is that if you go to Site X and say "I'm travisswicegood.com", Site X knows where I'm going for my identity.  It can then make a request to that, mimic it's behavior, and fool you into putting your password in there.  With CardSpace, Site X doesn't know anything about how you provided the identity to it.</p>

<p>Kim views CardSpace and OpenID as complimentary.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, looks like all I needed to do was threaten myself with staying home from MTS07 and I'd get better.  My allergies are still horrible, but I'm not sick like I was the other day.</p>

<p>All that's left to do on m todo list for today is to get my bags packed and hit the airport tomorrow.  One of the guys from Microsoft that's flying in for the summit is landing 15 minutes before me and is renting a car so I managed to hitch a ride from the airport.  Looking at the resumes of the folks who are attending, I almost feel a bit out of place.  There's a lot of people with more years in the tech industry than I've been alive!</p>

<p>I'm curious to see what's up at the campus.  If you have any questions you'd like to hear an answer to from Microsoft, just leave a comment and I'll ask away if I get the ear of the right person.  Personally, I'm interested in finding out how much longer MS plans on developing a custom engine for Internet Explorer before dropping it in favor of Gecko so they can leverage the power of open source in their browser and finally get standards compliant and secure.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'll be blogging anything interesting from the conference and I'm sure there'll be plenty of <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog">moblog</a> pictures.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ouch.  I&#39;ve been doing one thing or another since Saturday, or I would have posted before now, but ouch.  Saturday was the first time I&#39;ve gone on one of the group road rides up here.  It was crazy.  We had a tail wind, so that helped move us along on the way out, but we were averaging well over 25 on the warm up.</p><p>I kept ending up toward the front and not one to shirk a pull, I kept pulling through.  We hit the &quot;steps&quot; (or as I think they should be called, &quot;the bitches&quot; - if you&#39;ve ever done Old Pueblo you know what I&#39;m talking about.  We hit the bottom of the first climb doing 30+ and I believe they kept it near or over 20 the whole way up.  For any of my European readers, I do mean miles per hour, not kilometers.</p><p>I slugged up the climbs, and was settling in to a few hour solos when they stopped at a turn and I caught back on.  I hung with &#39;em again until the accelleration into Morman Lake.  We were doing nearly 30 and someone went off of the front and it was on.  I wasn&#39;t too worried about being dropped there because I knew they&#39;d be stopping just little bit further up the road for refills and the like.  I came around a corner and saw somebody picking themselves up out of the gravel.  Apparently in all the jockeying for position, two guys touched shoulders.  One of them was right at the shoulder and happened to be in some cinders at the time and ate it.  Had a really nice rasberry, but was back on his bike and finished the ride out.</p><p>After the lodge stop in Morman Lake, I hung with them to the next climb again and was shelled.  I caught back on to a few more riders at Lake Mary and hung with them for awhile, but they were both running upper 20&#39;s trying to catch on to the last half dozen or so riders from the main group.  I did one pull and my legs were done.  Bid them adieu, and settled in for a solo back in to town.  Just before I got past the lower Lake Mary, I pulled the plug on the ride and called in a ride back to town.  I ended up with just under 2:45 moving and a touch over 53 miles.  The last 11 miles took nearly 45 minutes.</p><p>Again, I say... ouch.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ugh!  This past week I was out hiking and commented several times "this is just too dry..." or "the forest is gonna close form a month..." or just shear screams of horror.  With all of this warm weather, the forests are going to be a tinderbox this late spring/early summer.  Sure enough, this past week we got our <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0313wildfire-ON.html">first taste</a> of things to come.</p>

<p>I hope I'm wrong.  Cycling becomes too expensive if you get caught poaching...  Hell, with the <a href="http://www.ridingthespine.com/Journey/uncategorized/denouement">recent examples being made of cyclists</a>, I might even end up with US Marshall's following me around the state, posing as independent magazine writers, and trying throw me in the pokey.</p>

<p>I saw him yesterday when we had Tig getting his shots.  After some thinking about it last night and this morning, we decided to head out and see how he acted one-on-one.  He's a big puppy (and by big, I mean 70 pounds).  I decided that with the money I would be spending at the national opener in a few weeks, I could get a dog, and have a lot more to bring home.  :-D</p>

<p>He's already used to being around other dogs and is fine and was great at the pet store today with the other dogs and people that were hanging out.  I'm sure with a little work, he's going to be a great mountain bike companion when I'm out for a spin.</p>

It's just pictures taken and posted from my camera phone.  I <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/030807_13531.jpg.html">posted</a> <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/030807_14001.jpg.html">a</a> <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/030807_14361.jpg.html">few</a> from this afternoon's ride.</p>

<p>Today was beautiful.  A high of 60~, those big fluffy clouds in the sky, a tolerable wind, and mountains in view.  Today was only the second time I've been on a mountain bike up here this year, and it was a spiritual experience.  Like all good <em>societies</em>, it's hard to explain what the spiritual part of mountain biking is like to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Coming back from my explorations of the <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/passages/pass_31.html">AZ Trail</a>, I hit <abbr title="Forest Road">FR</abbr> 303 and was just cruising along.  I got into this meditative state that was just pure bliss.  Flow is what I've heard it called; the zone, effortless motion, they all describe it.  As I cranked out the trip home, I got to thinking about all of the people in my life that have made me the person I am today and gave me what was necessary to make the choices to be here, on a national park's forest road, amongst the pines, sun shining down as I hit that state of nirvanic exhaustion and it crossed my consciousness that I haven't thanked them all.</p>

<p>So thanks.  To each and every one of you who've made me who I am - and you know who you are - thanks.  This ride's for you. :-)</p>

        <title>Domain51_Testing_Selenium package released</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/03/06/domain51_testing_selenium_package_releas/"/>
        <updated>2007-03-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/03/06/domain51_testing_selenium_package_releas</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you know me as a programmer, you know I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">tests</a>.  Just in the last 4 months or so I started using <a href="http://openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> to test web applications.  It's great, and with the <a href="http://openqa.org/selenium-ide/">IDE</a>, creating simple tests is a snap.  It doesn't take long before a simple test turns into something more complex.  You might need to setup or teardown some of the test elements so you know what to expect.</p>

<p>In steps the something like <a href="http://simpletest.org">SimpleTest</a>.  There's been a <a href="http://pear.php.net/Testing_Selenium">Testing_Selenium</a> as part of <abbr title="PHP Extension and Application Repository">PEAR</abbr> for awhile now, but it implements an API that doesn't match up with Selenium-IDE.  In an effort to make the PHP interface with Selenium look the same as the IDE interface, I've release a new Domain51_Testing_Selenium.  It borrows heavily from the original TS package, but simplifies the code.  </p>

<p>Without docs, I have a sub 100 line piece of code that provides the full Selenium-IDE API, considering the PEAR TS package is over 2500 lines (most of which are just docs, but it's still huge), I'm pretty happy.</p>

<p>Few things to note: </p>

<ol><li>No docs yet - only for the fearless :-)</li>
<li>This version only supports cURL connections</li>
<li>The instantiation (minus driver), and starting and stopping of tests work exactly like Testing_Selenium</li>
<li>It's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a> - Do whatever you want with it, but if you redistribute it, you have to do it <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">freely</a> - as in speech, not beer.</li>
</ol>

<p>That last link is a good read if you want to get started on the "Commie-social-commune-treehugging-softare can change the world-did somebody say beer" bandwagon. :-)</p>

<p>In case it's not self-evident (to my programming readers anyhow) how to use this, I put together a quick <a href="http://domain51.googlecode.com/svn/Domain51/trunk/tests/SeleniumAccessingGoogleTest.php">test case</a> using Google.  You can download the PEAR installable package <a href="http://domain51.googlecode.com/files/Domain51_Testing_Selenium-0.0.1.tgz">here</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ouch, ouch, ouch.  Oh, and did I say ouch?  Yesterday, I went to the Yoga Basics class offered at <a href="http://www.flagstaffathleticclub.com/">FAC</a>.  I really enjoyed the class because a lot of the poses had "you can stop here, or..." and there were more advanced continuations of the poses for those who weren't doing yoga for the first time.  I'm a pretty flexible guy, so I followed along taking it as far as I could.  I'm happy to report that I was able to do all of the poses (even the <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/785_1.cfm">eagle pose</a>), though some were definitely more graceful than others.</p>

<p>But today...  <strong>Ouch!</strong>  As I write this, I've got a heating pad on my back to try to get blood back into the muscle so it can do its thing.  I forgot how bad the morning after of yoga could be.</p>

        <title>Name change in Pipes - introducing Argil</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/02/28/name_change_in_pipes_introducing_argil</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, where has the last week gone?  I've been meaning to announce this, but keep getting caught up in other tasks.  A few weeks ago when Yahoo announced their new Pipes framework, I decided that I was going to rename the code.  I didn't want to spend all of my time as "Pipes (Not the Yahoo! kind)" and I was worried there'd be confusion in what it was all about.</p>

<p>So, I've got a shiny new name.  Introducing <a href="http://argil.org">Argil</a>.  It's the same code, but with a new name and site.  I've also setup an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/argil">Argil SourceForge</a> project.</p>

<p>A few updates.  First, I've ported all of <a href="http://mootools.net">Mootools</a> into a namespaced version.  Going forward, this will be the JS toolkit that Argil uses to insure maximum compatibility with all other JS frameworks and - in my opinion the most important part - <a href="http://openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a>.</p>

        <title>Why start Yet Another Framework?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/02/19/why_start_yet_another_framework/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/02/19/why_start_yet_another_framework</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's been <a href="http://killersoft.com/randomstrings/2007/02/16/rails-free-living/">tons</a> of (sometimes) <a href="http://www.gravitonic.com/blog/archives/000359.html">heated</a> debate over starting frameworks in PHP.  Apparently, <a href="http://www.planet-php.net/?start=10">Planet PHP</a> picked up my post from nearly 6 weeks ago announcing Pipes and posted it as a new announcement.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the general concensus has been "why start something?  why not just help out?"  Well, my answer can pretty much be summed in <a href="http://forum.mootools.net/topic.php?id=1692&amp;replies=13#post-7994">Valerio's response</a> to my Mootools patch from last week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>tswicegood: very nice experiment.</p>

<blockquote><p>Any thoughts, ideas? Valerio, is this something you see a reasonable to include in Mootools? </p></blockquote>

<p>No, unfortunately not, I have no intention of doing something like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm left with the option of "pick[ing] another framework", forking Mootools, or starting yet another javascript framework.  Personally, I have no interest in starting a javascript framework.  Too much work and it's not an area that I have a tremendous amount of expertise in.</p>

<p>I am actively considering forking Mootools, though.  I personally really enjoy it.  It's a good, lightweight framework that jives with my development style.  The only thing I want is a namespaced version of it, which I have developed and offered as a patch and had summarily rejected.  If I fork it, it'll just be keeping up with releases with all of the goodies included.  I figure that's got to be useful to anyone else who wants their Mootools code to be testable with Selenium, so...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don't understand why Javascript frameworks have to have a "my way or the highway" mentality about them.  I love <a href="http://mootools.net">Mootools</a>.  Nice, simple, very compact (36k for the full version with documentation if you gzip it), promotes <abbr title="object oriented">OO</abbr> code, but it doesn't play well with others.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> to create tests for web applications.  It allows you to record a series of actions, then replay the actions again and again later to make sure nothing's broken.  It's a very, very useful tool, but it uses <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> which doesn't get along with Mootools.  Basically, the second Moo is loaded, Prototype freaks out and takes Selenium down with it.</p>

<p>The solution is pretty easy.  Javascript makes namespacing easy with little overhead.  It'd be so easy to have <code>Moo.Ajax</code> and <code>Prototype.Ajax</code> so they could work together without issues.  As <a href="http://mad4milk.net/">Valerio</a> righly <a href="http://forum.mootools.net/topic.php?id=1639&amp;replies=7#post-7891">pointed out</a>, having to prefix everything with "Moo." is pretty redunant, but you add in a <code>CompatibilityMode</code> that's off by default.  It gives those of us who like to mix our frameworks the ability to do so by adding additional code and doesn't change anything for those who don't care.</p>

<p>I won't go so far as to say it's arrogant on the part of the framework developers to assume that they're the only thing I'll ever use, but by not playing well with each other they sure limit their usefulness.</p>

        <title>What to do when the world snows you in</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/02/14/what_to_do_when_the_world_snows_you_in</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You think about the good ol' days; when life was simple.  Just you, your bike, and maybe a long sleeved jersey to take the bite off of the wind as you descended into the desert from on high.  Oh wait, that was two days ago... ;-)</p>

<p>Sorry, just couldn't resist the poke at all those who are getting snowed in.  We got snow this morning and yesterday early, but it's largely gone now.  It'll keep me from the mountain bike trails for a bit longer, but the roads should be in top shape soon with temperatures nearly 50 on Saturday and Sunday.  Gotta love Februaries like this :-)</p>

<p>Monday I decided to spend a good part of the afternoon communing with my masochistic side.  I parked at the stop of the Painted Desert loop just off of 89, and rode down, down, down.  35 minutes worth.  There's some rollers the first few miles, but about mile 6 as you go around the <a href="http://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/sunset_crater_volcano/suns2.html">cinder cone</a> it starts headed down.  Somewhere along there I topped out at 40 mph.  Mind you, that's with a compact crank!  If I was rolling the big gears I'm sure you could scream down near 50 mph.</p>

<p>This has to be one of my favorite rides so far.  13 miles of down, 13 miles of up.  Like I said, there's 5 miles with no sustained climbs, but the rest of it is just a steady climb.  The whole scenic loop is 35 miles.  If you hop back on 89, it turns into 46 round trip, but I'm thinking an out and back might be fun.</p>

<p>Here's the ride data...  The elevation profile has a remarkable resemblance to what one mega-best seller referred to as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalice_%28cup%29#Da_Vinci_Code">chalice</a>...</p>

<p>And since posts with pictures seem to get the most comments, here's a few I snapped <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-pics/sunset-crater-2007-02-12/">on the ride</a>.</p>

Yup - that's snow on the ground. And it was 45 degrees! :-)</p>

Oh baby! If only there was a peleton chasing me and I was the lone man in a break away. That horizon out there in the distance, that's where the road leads (well, half way there).</p>

The mountain at the top of the road is where I'm headed, the mountain to the right is Humphrey's (and a nice little 12k mas y menos). Note the scenery change. I'm in a juniper forest instead of a pine forest now.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arizona has some of the coolest scenery in the country.  It's definitely some of the most diverse.  Yesterday afternoon I took the car for a spin along a route I've been wanting to check out, the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;ll=35.451721,-111.457672&amp;spn=0.364132,0.641327&amp;t=h&amp;om=1">Sunset Crater Loop</a>.  I can't wait until I can get out there with a bike!</p>

<p>You drop from the old growth pine forests at 7k into the juniper forests at 6k, then into what I call the high desert plain (I'm sure that's not it's real name) at 5k, then climb back up.  If you switch to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=11&amp;ll=35.451721,-111.457672&amp;spn=0.364132,0.641327">map mode</a>, you'll notice all of those little dirt roads going every which way.  I'm thinking there are some opportunities to hook together some crazy long rides out there.  And if you follow 89 north almost to Cameron, there's the turn off to the Grand Canyon.  If you ever wanted to do a big day on a road bike, that'd be a pretty sweet loop.</p>

<p>And I'll leave you with a picture:</p>

<p>If you're let me wax sentimental for a minute.  How many people go their whole lives and not see a sunset like that?  Probably too many.  The sun was setting beautifully in the west, but I turned to the east to snap that shot.  How lucky am I that that's a half hour from my front door?  How lucky am I that that's around an hour from my front door by bike?  </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lots of people have been asking about the job front and I'm happy to report that this past week I joined on as the lead developer at a locale design/development company, <a href="http://www.northland-advertising.com/">Northland Advertising</a>.  It will be a fun opportunity to shape their code as they start to move toward becoming a development company focusing on tools that help set their clients apart from their competition.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a company in Flag that was looking for a top shelf developer.  Turns out I'm not the only professional in the world that wants to make a living in the mountains here in Flagstaff.</p>

<p>On the "wish it was my job front", I still haven't seen the full results for <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/01/29/first_farce_of_the_year_mcdowell_meltdow">last week's marathon</a>, but I do have my final number from last week's marathon.  19th!  Ouch.  Looks like there were a lot more to that field than I realized.  Oh well, it's still January.  I have plenty of time to get fast. :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was taking care of all of my bills when it dawned on me that I hadn't seen a DSL bill from Qwest in quite some time, if ever.  I had vague recollections of getting a bill, but wasn't sure when it came and what I had done with it.  I looked around and couldn't find it in my inbox, my file drawer; it had disappeared, if it had even come.  Then it dawned on me, not only was I not finding the bill for January, I couldn't find any of my past bills.</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the more vague the memory became.  Was it a Qwest or Verizon bill that came and I'm thinking about?  With a new power and gas and water bill, all the bills were coming from new places with new logos.  Maybe I never did receive a bill?  After all, wouldn't one of the payments show up in my bill pay?  </p>

<p>I ended up calling Qwest, by this time pretty sure I'd never received a bill at all.  Their phone menu is horrible.  I don't need new service, and I'm not a business account (or some equally specific purpose).  After two unsuccessful attempts at speaking "operator" - since it was a voice activated menu - I just went to the new customer line for DSL.  The guy seemed quite cheery for a phone back guy.  I haven't ordered something by phone in a long time so I guess that's why it surprised me.  It makes sense to keep the happy folk talking to new/potential customers and put the grouches - err, I mean less happy folk answering calls from customers you already have.</p>

<p>After a quick explanation that I probably had the wrong person and that I needed to speak with someone about my bill I managed to get transferred to the correct place.  It takes a few attempts to convey "I've had service for three months, but I don't have any bills" to the person.  Once she understood, she started looking through my account.  It took a few minutes, and during that time almost on an interval she said something to the effect, "this will just take a minute longer...".  I wonder if they have a pop-up on their computer that reminds them to thank us for holding and tell us it'll just take a little bit longer.  Anyhow, I was definitely in the system, there was no outstanding balance, and she couldn't see a single bill in the system.  "I'm going to have to send this to the billing department so they can figure out what's happened."  Then she said, "well, at least your honest and called us about it."</p>

<p>So, long story short, I should have a nice sized 3 - 4 month DSL bill in the mail before too long.  They're supposed to call me once they figure things out and I still haven't received a call so who knows.  Maybe I'll get to keep the free service... </p>

        <title>First farce of the year: McDowell Meltdown Marathon</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/29/first_farce_of_the_year_mcdowell_meltdow/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/29/first_farce_of_the_year_mcdowell_meltdow</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow.  January and I get to post my first race report of the year.  To top it off to all of my riders a bit further east and north of me, it was a race that only required arm warmers for the first lap.  Yup, shorts and short sleeves in January.  Gotta love Arizona.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned in the last post, the marathon won the debate on which race to do.  That meant an alarm clock going off at 4 in the morning to drive down for the race.  No biggie, pretty easy couple of hours on the road and I was at the venue, my <a href="http://www.maricopa.gov/parks/mcdowell/">old stomping grounds</a> really pysch'ed about the race.  I get ready, not paying too much attention to a warm up cause of time constraints, and it's a four hour race, I'll warm up on the course.  At the line, <a href="http://d-rock-mtb.blogspot.com/">New Mexico's own superman</a> is at the line.  Well, there goes any thoughts of winning, but who cares?  It'll still be 4 hours or so of fun hammering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They're going over the info on the race and one of the guy's working there starts going down the line asking for the green slips of paper they gave you with your number at the registration.  Huh?  When I picked up my number, the guy told me they were out of swag bags and told me to come back after the race and pick one up.  Ok, cool... I've got a number to give 'em when I come back for it.  </p>

<p>Nope.  Apparently, this number that they didn't mention to me at all (or on their <a href="http://mbaa.net/racing/race1.html">race site</a> for that matter) is now necessary to start.</p>

<p>Me: "I don't have mine?"</p>

<p>"I've got to have the number..." and he keeps walking down the line.</p>

<p>He comes back.  Me again, "Do I have to have it?"  "Yeah"  "It's at my car, do you want me to go get it?"  "If I don't have it, how am I going to know you started?"</p>

<p>Crap.  Two minutes or so to the start, and I've got to pull off of the line to go get a stupid piece of paper?  Great.  Back to the car I go... It was locked and <a href="http://leftof.net">Meg</a>, who had gone to help with water/gel hand-offs had the keys.  Now I've got to go find her.  Find her, back to the car.  Where's the piece of paper?  I tear the car about looking for it, but it's nowhere to be found.  Welp, looks like I'm out for a 4 lap fun ride.</p>

<p>Back to the starting line.  "Who's taking the green tickets?"  I'm getting ready to tell 'em I don't have mine any more and I'm just going out.  "Are you doing the Marathon?"  "Yeah", "Just go!".  Off I go.  Now I'm pissed...  Why didn't the guy tell me that ten minutes ago?!</p>

<p>Anyhow, I channel that energy into the pedals, and off I go chasing.  It took me a little over a lap to make contact.  I started picking people off every few minutes.  Got passed a good portion of the women's field (I think it was all of it, but I'm not sure) and a handful of the men's field.  My tunnel vision as the race started told me there was 12 - 18 men in the field, so I either managed to work back in to the top 2/3rd of the field, or 1/2 of the field.</p>

<p>The only real snafu of the race that was my fault (unless not playing 20 questions at the sign-in makes not knowing about the green card makes the start my fault) was the last gel hand off.  The first one I did was at the same stop I swapped out camelbaks, so no problems there.  On the third lap, I came up on this one guy at the bottom of the South Rim.  At the top of the South Rim I couldn't see him, so that gives you an idea the kind of time I made up on him.  Once he realizes I'm behind him though he finds this new reserve of energy and off he goes.  I'm faster than he is on the climbs, the technical, everything, except flat out where he's going just fast enough that it'd take too much energy to pass him.  I finally get him at one of the shallow climbs, but he sticks with me as much as he can.</p>

<p>We make it back to the start/finish and they're staging the Pros and Expert field.  This guy is less than a hundred yards behind me and I'm really racheting it up to drop him.  Then the Pro/Experts start and they stop us at the crossing to let us go.  Crap.  2 and a half hours of racing and now you want me to sit on my bike for 30 seconds?  I'm afraid cramps are going to take hold now, but try to keep focused as much as I can.  When they let us go again, I'm off.  I've got this guy who's been riding my wheel the whole time with me now and I'm focused on dropping him.  This is when I go through the feed zone.  I grab the gel flask, but it slips out of my hand for whatever reason.  Oh well, I've got enough in reserves for one more lap and I've got someone on my wheel.</p>

<p>If I had it to do again, knowing what I knew then, I'd still keep going.  But I could have stopped, got the flask, and still been fine.  By the time I got to the top of the climb out of the parking lot (the top of the Sport loop), I couldn't see the guy any longer.  All it took was 3 - 4 minutes of climbing and he was completely popped.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I managed to keep the cramps at bay, but could definitely tell I was running on fumes that last lap.  I couldn't really push the climbs any longer and was dropping out of the middle ring for the first time all day.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a good race.  I accomplished what I wanted to - sub 4 hours (my clock is 3:56) and felt good the whole race.  That's a lot more than I can say for my first <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/24/well_i_ve_gone_and_done_it">race last year</a>.  Even though I won the race through attrition, I faded hard during that one.</p>

<p>Few miscellaneous notes: I'm talking with <a href="http://www.wingnutgear.com/">Wingnut</a> and hopefully I can work out a deal with them to start using their packs at these races.  I've been riding with my Hyper 2.5 since last August, and it only took an hour or so riding with a regular camelbak and my lower back was screaming at me.</p>

<p>I also lowered my saddle a bit for this race.  I think part of the back issue has been my seat bordering on just a bit too high.  I'm not rocking my hips (the tell-tale sign), but I do end up with my lower foot extended through the pedal stroke.  Based on some reading I've been doing, I believe lowering it will help me focus the muscle strain away from my back and back into my legs where it belongs.  I didn't have any issues on the Sedona ride with the Hyper 2.5, so I'm thinking Saturday's issue was the pack.  Some more experimenting will tell.</p>

<p>One final note.  Anyone who's said anything anywhere near me about buying wheels in the last year knows that I sing the praises of <a href="http://speeddream.com/">Speed Dream</a> wheels.  Dave knows his stuff and has built a set of super light, super stiff 29'er wheels for me.  I mean, we're talking off the shelf 26" XC race wheels kind of light - just a couple of grams over 1600.  Anyhow, Friday night I'm packing my car up, cleaning off the Sedona mud, just general race prep stuff.  I set my front wheel out of the way up against the garage door opening.  Nice, out of the way, somewhere I won't forget about it.</p>

<p>The garage door at this place is the old kind.  The new one's you can blow on and they'll start back up.  I've grabbed this one and pushed while it was closing and it didn't go back up.  Well, I'm sure you can see where this is going.  I finish up out side, hit the garage door button and come back inside.  30 minutes later I go back out to grab my camelbaks to fill 'em up and the door's still open.  I look around and there's my wheel.  Nice...  It's not tacoed, but "there goes my $40 for pre-registering" enters my mind.  I pick it up, give it a whirl, and there's a little bounce to the spin.  It's not wobbling uncontrollably though.</p>

<p>On the truing stand I can see the slight wobble.  It's hardly anything.  A quarter turn on a handful of spokes and it's spinning like a new wheel.  Yup, Dave's wheels can take an old garage door coming down on them and barely get knocked out of true.  That's on a year old set of wheels that have been trued once and have the abuse of three marathons, plus nearly all of my NMORS races from last year on them.  That's what I call bomb proof...</p>

<p>Now for the moment of truth:<br />

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Still have a few things to finish up tonight before I hit the hay early.  The plan for tomorrow is to be on the road by 5.  I decided on the marathon.  This early in the season 4 hours at a steady just below XC race pace is better than less than 2 hours at a full on race pace.  That, and the marathon course at this race is just going to be a 29'er dream.  It's flowy, no sustained climbs, no sustained descents, just ripping fast single track.</p>

<p>I have no clue what the field's going to be like tomorrow.  If last fall's series is any indication, it'll be tiny.  They had a couple of races last year with two guys in 'em.  If it's that small, definitely makes tactics interesting.  Do you let someone ride off with the intent of reeling 'em in, or set a ripper pace at the start to try and dishearten 'em?  Since this will only be my second time on a mountain bike this year, I'm planning on racing my race. </p>

<p>Yesterday I hit the road for some mountain bike time prior to the race.  It was beautiful up here - mid 40s, not a cloud in the sky - but damp with the snow melting.  I decided yesterday was as good of a time as any to hit the red rock in Sedona since I've been in Arizona for over a year now and still haven't ridden there.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/6159-2/templeton-trail-sedona-az.jpg" alt="Templton Trail in Sedona, AZ" /></p>

<p>Man, it's hard having trails like that less than an hour away you can ride on in January with shorts and a short-sleeved shirt.  Brutal, I tell ya... ;-)</p>

<p>44 miles of some of the sweetest 29'er trails in Arizona...  It's a super fast course with a great flow.  I haven't gotten any good distance riding in a while, so this might just be the kick start my year needs.  If only I knew for sure that they were doing 5 Marathons this year and I'm not shooting myself in the foot for points in the XC.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I thought it'd be fun to shake up the normal workout with some swimming.  Figured 30 - 45 minutes doing some laps at the <a href="http://www.flagstaffathleticclub.com/">local gym</a>.  Ouch...  My shoulders are going to be so sore tomorrow.  The pool at the east location (which I can see from my balcony) is only a half lap.  Going down and coming back the first few times though, I couldn't even make it back (was lacking something 10 feet).  After the turn around, for some reason I couldn't get enough air in.  I'm not used to having to take short deep breathes.  I think that's what was throwing me off.</p>

<p>I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCore-Performance-Endurance-Nutrition-Revolutionizes%2Fdp%2F1594863520%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1169583712%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Core Performance Endurance</a> yesterday.  A lot of the exercises look like new-age Pilates to me, which is great as that focuses on core (or in Pilate's lingo "trunk") strength and strengthening muscles without bulking up.  As <a href="http://soiledchamois.blogspot.com/">Mahokey</a> will attest, not many exercise/health/nutrition magazines or books or websites targeted toward men deal with anything but bulging biceps.  Anyhow, I'm going to start working up a strategy incorporate it into my training.  Once I've given it some time, I'll post up what my thoughts on it are.  <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/default.aspx">Dave</a> really liked the original and cites it as <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2007/01/01/2229.aspx">one of the things</a> that's made him the racer he is today.</p>

<p>I'm really starting to get excited about this weekend.  First race of the year and the first time I've been at a starting line since the end of August.  </p>

        <title>Better Plumbing... Pipes v0.2 is out</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/21/better_plumbing_pipes_v0_2_is_out/"/>
        <updated>2007-01-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/21/better_plumbing_pipes_v0_2_is_out</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks and two releases.  I'm on a roll. :-)</p>

<p>I just released <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/">Pipes</a> v0.2 which is available from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpinpipes/">Pipes project page</a> on Google Code.  Notable new features:</p>

<ul><li>AJAX! - and no Francios, I'm not renaming Pipes now... ;-)</li>
<li>Integration with <a href="http://mootools.net/">Mootools</a> to provide the AJAX and some basic effects</li>
<li>You can browse by tags which brings tag support up a notch</li>
<li>New model finders: these allow you to encapsulate finding logic into objects that can then be used by all model mappers</li>
<li>The default HTML page is now based on the <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/17/">CSS Framework</a></li>
<li>Did I mention AJAX support?</li></ul>

<p>Yesterday I put together a new site for <a href="http://phpinpipes.org">Pipes</a>.  It shows some of the eye candy (hint: hover your mouse over words that have dots under them) and the new logo/slogan.  I owe a big thanks to <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">my sister</a> for keeping me from using some marketing-y slogan and keeping it simple and funny.  <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/"><em>Pipes - Better Plumbing</em></a>.  </p>

<p>A big thanks also to a former colleague and buddy who's been critiquing ideas since Pipes was just a thought in my head <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh Eichorn</a>.  He's helped out big time with this release by allowing me to play 20 questions on AJAX and JavaScript while I figured out exactly what I needed/wanted to do to get AJAX into Pipes.</p>

<p>Now that Pipes is in a pretty much usable state (even though it lacks the kind of documentation I want for it), I've got a few pet projects I'm going to work on and see how they turn out.  You'll see links here if anything comes of them.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/19/oh_the_pain</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've got a couple of inches of fresh snow on the ground, and my night's been turned upside down.  <a href="http://usacycling.org/">USA Cycling</a> finally "rolled out" it's <a href="http://usacycling.org/news/user/story.php?id=2714">nationals calendar</a>.  53 races?  The good news, the <a href="http://norbanationals.com/">NMBS</a> (whose website is getting overhauled right now) opener in Fountain Hills is a Cat 1 race which means more points.  How many more points?  Who knows... I couldn't find the break down, except that Cat 4 races are the least points, Cat 1s are the most, and 2s and 3s fall somewhere in between.  There's lots of races though, and several old familiars that I'd probably be attending anyhow.</p>

<p>But the hard part... there's a new <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/forms/mbnc/MTBNatzCalendar_UltraEndurance.pdf">ultra endurance</a> series.  6 races, with half of them being within a 12 hour drive.  The <a href="http://www.desertsportstx.com/events.html">Mas y Menos 100k</a> in Texas starts things off (13 hours mas y menos according to Google); the third race is the <a href="http://www.tucsonracing.com/PSMinf07.htm">Payson Pounder</a> and hour and a half away, and the series wraps up another 12 hours away at the <a href="http://www.knobbytireseries.com/index.php?id=3#201">Galena Grinder</a> in Ketchum, Idaho.  So now it's got me wondering...  Is another year focusing on ultras the way to go?  Doing any two of those races in the 19 - 29 would probably net me a series win in that division, but I did that last year.  I'm wondering how many pros will be doing the open...  Would three races with strong finishes be enough to take it since they're so far apart?  What about an east coast challenger?  The series is weighted to them since someone in the Carolinas or Georgia is within a 3 or 4 hour drive from all of the races.</p>

<p>The final for the ultra series would be a week after the national championships in Vermont, so I'd definitely be getting some travel in the latter part of July if I go that route and still try to do the nationals.  Minus travel, I should be in as close to peak form as I'll be all year those two weeks.</p>

I wonder if he mountain bikes?  Anyhow...  </p>

<p>I was a little disappointed in his site, though.  I went there sure that he would have some "<em>Barak '08</em>" buttons to use on blogs to try to build up some grass roots support, but nope.  Nothing of the sort.  Clinton has a few, but most are huge and don't work well on blogs.</p>

<p>Upset at not being able to show my support in a geeky way, I decided to take matters in to my <a href="http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/">own hands</a> and here is the result:</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="imgRight" src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/humphreys-peak.jpg" alt="Humphrey&#039;s Peak going up the Snowbowl" title="Humphrey&#039;s Peak going up the Snowbowl" width="400" height="300" />Views like that can be the norm on a Monday afternoon. :-)</p>

<p>After this past week, I'm no longer at <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>.  I worked with some great and unbelievably talented people there, but it was time to move on.  I don't have anything particular lined up just yet, but I've got a few things in the works.  If you know of anyone needing a crack PHP guy, leave me a comment.</p>

<p>Right now, I would love to find a company (or just person if someone's got the money and a love of open source) that's interested in seeing how far a <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/">rapid application development framework</a> like <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/">Pipes</a> can be pushed in the PHP community.  This past weekend I got v0.1 of it out and I'm really pushing to get v0.2 out soon as that'll have most of the major pieces I need in my development work: code generation, AJAX, relationship handling, and some basic user authentication.</p>

<p>Another thing that's been floating around in the back of my head is a web-based cycling training tool.  There's several really good tools that are all PC based, and then there's tools like MotionBased that are great for casual tracking and some bling, but nothing that's a powerful training tool.  There's some great opportunities there as training in its most basic form is pretty straight forward: apply these rules for managing how you're going to ride today based on what your goals and timelines are for the rest of the season.  It seems like that knowledge could distilled with some very basic algorithms to provide rudimentary instructions to people who want to "train", but don't want to have a super rigid schedule.  It could also be taken to the next level with some of the power stuff that <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/">Dave's</a> been working on to give you a "do this today for this long and this hard" kind of instructions for those wanting something more complex.</p>

<p>Anyhow...  That's where I'm at.  My legs are completely dead now though.  Monday's ride was preceded by a morning at the gyms doing leg weights.  Yeah, real smart, eh?  45 minutes of some pretty intense leg weights followed by <a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/dashboard.mb?episodePk.pkValue=1877478">two and a half hours</a> that was practically straight up for the first hour and a half.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, at least the geeky part of it...  I just finished tagging a release for <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/">Pipes</a>, a new PHP framework I've been playing with in my spare time for the last month or two.  This is the <a href="http://phpinpipes.org">first release</a> of what I hope will be many.</p>

<p>Cool features worth mentioning:</p>
<ul><li>Automatic code generation</li>
<li>Full database reflection so there's no configuring objects to work the database, they just do</li>
<li>Built-in tagging</li></ul>

<p>I'm sure there's more worth mentioning, but I've spent the last two days trying to keep from getting a cold so my mind's not fully here.  Something about the 6th of January.  Last year I had the same problem... Of course then, it was because I'd been on a bike putting in serious miles every day of the year.  This year, I'm not sure what's up.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you're a rich open-source software benefactor that would like fund a great new project, leave me a comment. :-)</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/04/calling_all_mountain_bike_geeks</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite sites online is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.  A repository of knowledge that's completely transparent, living, and breathing - free for all to use and contribute to; it appeals to the communal in me.</p>

<p>The other day I decided to see what Wikipedia had on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking">Mountain biking</a>, and particularly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mountain_bike_racing">racing</a>.  As you can see, not much.  They do have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mountain_bikers">65 mountain bikers</a> listed, but a large portion of those articles are incomplete or missing current information.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Haywood">Sue Haywood</a> didn't have her win at the 24 Hour Worlds listed until I added it the other day.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Brown_%28cyclist%29">Travis Brown</a> doesn't have anything listed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Brown_%28cyclist%29#Significant_results">results</a> listed for 2006, even though he won two marathons that I witnessed and managed a 3rd place in one while racing a single speed in the open/pro category.  That's just two that are missing results, not to mention the handful of other one's that I've come across.</p>

<p>So I'm making it a goal to go to the site whenever I have a chance and fix up some results, add info, basically try to adopt mountain biking on Wikipedia.  If you've got some spare time and have the slightest idea what a wiki is I could use some help... :-)</p>

        <title>Three hundred thousand foot man</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/03/three_hundred_thousand_foot_man/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2007/01/03/three_hundred_thousand_foot_man</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I managed to barely squeak past <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man">100, 000 vertical feet</a>.  Actually, the numbers were pretty small but I was pleased consider there were whole months that I hardly rode at all.  Well, I finally got the numbers tallied for 2006, so without any further adieu.</p>

<table><tr><th></th><th>Total Rides</th><th>Time (hours</th><th>Miles</th><th>Feet Climbed</th></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Mountain Bike</th><td>70</td><td>153.36</td><td>1299.5</td><td>173978.7</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Road Bike Rides</th><td>88</td><td>95.46</td><td>1531.82</td><td>138789</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Totals</th><td>158</td><td>248.82</td><td>2831.32</td><td>312767.7</td></tr>
</table>

<p>I averaged 3.04 rides per week, spending 4.79 hours per week on the bike, and averaged 54.45 miles per week.  Compared to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man#c4721">last year</a>, I trippled my hours in the saddle, more than doubled my miles.  I'd have to dig out my data from last year, but I don't think I even broke 100 rides last year, so I know I got in more there.</p>

<p>I need to work on early season burnout.  I raced way too much in the early season this past year.  By August I was ready to quit looking at my bike.  Definitely on my "needs work" list for 2007.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've got some major climbing right out my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/11/29/it_s_cold_outside">back door</a> now, though, so I'm thinking my first half million foot year might just been 2007 :-)  Keep an eye on <a href="http://tswicegood.motionbased.com">my MB site</a> for the data.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year all.  Spent last night kind of subdued... Was planning on going to the <a href="http://photos.azdailysun.com/images/fb_azds/preview/2/5/9/6/6952.jpg">pine cone drop</a> downtown, but decided against it after an hour an a half battling snow on my bike yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>It was 50 degrees, the roads were pretty well cleaned off, just a bit messy.  I'm planning on snow, but what the hell... I want to end the year the same way I began it - on a mountain bike.  Apparently, 2 or 3 miles east of here got a lot more snow the other day.  There was one point on the <a href="http://aztrail.org/">AZ Trail</a> that no one had been since the snow, and another long stretch where the only other people had been on skis.  It was something else plowing through 10" of snow and sweating because it's so warm out.  Crazy.</p>

<p>Anyhow - here's to another year...</p>

        <title>Learning Languages: Starting with Spanish</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've decided to take back up my learning of Spanish.  I do this at least once a year... I'll be hanging out at Barnes and Noble and the language aisle will catch my fancy.  After spending a half hour or so looking through the books, I'll walk away with a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpanish-Vocabulary-Julianne-Dueber%2Fdp%2F0764119850%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1167418017%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">vocabulary book</a>, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpanish-Idioms-Barrons-Eugene-Savaiano%2Fdp%2F0812090276%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1167417946%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">idiom book</a>, or if my bank account is really unlucky, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMastering-Spanish-Level-Audio-CDs%2Fdp%2F0764175971&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">audio course</a>.  Last night was that night for me.  I picked up a new small new books and determined to spend some time working on my Spanish.  I have an elementary understanding of the language.  I can pronounce words that I read relatively well - though knowing what I'm saying is a completely different issue - and can comprehend the language when spoken - though not at full speed.</p>

<p>This morning I spent thirty minutes with one of my Spanish/English dictionaries translating the introductory paragraphs from a few stories on <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ned=es_mx">Google News En Espanol</a>.  I figure it's a good way to expand my vocabulary a bit while gleaning some useful info in the process.</p>

<p>I've also decided to add a few other languages to my <em>to learn</em> list.  I've decided I want to learn Arabic (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic"><abbr title="Modern Standard Arabic">MSA</abbr></a>) and Chinese (probably Mandarin).  I don't know when I'll start on them, but they're on my list for this next year too.</p>

<p>I really can't believe this year is almost over.  It's been a whirlwind, in a great way.  Things have changed unbelievably this year, but so many things are just like they where.  Last year, I had just moved to a new city and was getting acquainted my surroundings; this year I'm doing the same.  Last year, I was excited about the upcoming race season but wasn't training nearly enough; this year, I'm excited about the upcoming race season and still not doing enough (but more than last year).  Can you believe it's just over a month until I hit the <a href="http://mbaa.net/racing/index.html">first race</a>?</p>

<p>Happy Holidays to all of you.</p>

This was the a crazy ride back in October that I apparently didn't mention on my blog.  </p>

<p>Here's the quick stats: 26 miles, 5700' of climbing and decending, less than 4 hours of moving time with a 40 lbs bike, and oh yeah... I was out for nearly 9 hours!  (Long story short: one of the guys we were with took a nasty header - destroyed his helmet - had to be evacuated... did I mention it was 9 hours of riding?)</p>

        <updated>2006-12-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/12/09/on_effort</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2006/12/09/2187.aspx">Dave</a> I found <a href="http://teamdicky.blog.com/1337804/">Dicky's comments</a> about pushing yourself too far.  There's a great quote in the comments attributed to Eatough:</p>

<blockquote><p>I just think it came down to who was willing to destroy themselves the farthest, and Craig was more willing to go further. I also think that's why he's [in the hospital] and I'm [at home]</p></blockquote>

<p>I've often thought of pushing my limits as one of my limiting factors.  Once you hit the expert level and up in mountain biking, it's not uncommon to see guys come across the line and literally fall off the bike once they stop pedaling.  They've pushed their body right to the brink.  I heard an official at the very first road race I ever did (a 5k <abbr title="time trial">TT</abbr>) comment, "if [the racers] time this right they should vomit about 20 feet past the line".  I've yet to push myself that hard.</p>

<p>I have found that "extra" energy out on the course and been able to pick the pace up when I thought I was dead.  The last two laps at Nationals this past year, it hit me where I was at and that I'd been saving up some energy that was about to be wasted so I pushed the pace and picked up a handful of minutes on those last laps.  At the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report">Dusk 'til Dawn</a> in Gallup, I started catching glimpses of things out of the corner of my eyes and thought I was going to stop to vomit a few times, but pushed through it by convincing myself that the fatigue I was feeling was all psychological, but those are exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>I normally try to stay in a state of near effortless that <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2006/12/09/2187.aspx">Dave</a> is talking about.  I've heard it called "flow".  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBody-Mind-Sport-Mind-Body-Lifelong%2Fdp%2F0609807897%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1165683597%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Body, Mind, and Sport</a> is an excellent book on the topic and actually the book that formed my opinion about pushing yourself.  It talks about reaching the state of flow on demand by the way you train and live.</p>

<p>For me, that flow is right below my ventilatory threshold where I'm pushing at that point just below breaking.  It's where if I keep hydrated and fueled through the day I can go all day.  I often feel detached from what I'm doing.  I'm aware and fully engrossed in what I'm doing, but my mind goes on auto-pilot and becomes an observer of what's going on.  Instead of "rock, go left", my mind is commentating "rock, I'll miss it to the left".  That feeling, that effortless, that dissolving of the mind as part of the body and the body as part of the mind is as close to nirvana as I think I'll ever come.</p>

        <title>Open season declared on cyclists</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So apparently, they're selling cyclist licenses now in Illinois.  Of course, you've got to make sure you acted surprised.  You know, it's sort of like yelling "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimbo_Kern">it's coming right for us!</a>".  The "tags" aren't that expensive either, only $1,000 plus a six month waiting period before you can hunt again and the stupid hunter's - err, traffic safety education class.  But the beauty of it all, you don't have to worry 'bout the licenses and classes and such before you tag your first cyclist.  Just go out, do it, then say you're "very sorry" and you've just managed to tag yourself one of the most elusive, and some might say colorful of all game animals, the human cyclist.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2006/11/30/woman_is_sentenced_for_bicyclists_death">19-year-old girl</a> - with three prior moving violations since getting her license in May 2005 - runs over a 25-year-old cyclist who's riding on the shoulder and only has to pay $1,000 fine, serve a six month conditional discharge (probation without the probation officer), and don't forget the worst part... she has to go traffic safety school.  Personally, I've always considered the taking of a life through reckless behavior to be on par with the <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:Qu-rZXBK8QcJ:dnr.state.il.us/legal/adopted/635.pdf+feeding+wildlife+fine+illinois&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1">feeding of wildlife</a> (Section 635.50).  Yes, <a href="http://www.city.urbana.il.us/">Urbana judges</a> fined the girl the same amount as they would fine me if I were to put a salt lick out in my back yard in Urbana to attract deer.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?  What's the difference between what she's done and if I were stand in front of you, load a six-shooter with one bullet, spin the chamber, then point it at you and say "Odds are I won't kill you" before I pull the trigger?  Was her past driving record not enough to indicate that she was "willful[ly] and wanton[ly]" endangering those around her every time she got behind the wheel?  Wouldn't my loading a gun and pointing it at you would be the same endangerment?  Given the odds in my favor, could I not also say that the 16% chance that the gun would land on the chamber with a bullet meant that I could have "no reasonable expectation" that the gun would actually fire.  </p>

<p>And "reasonable expectation"?  Please, that excuses all sorts of crimes.  "I'm sorry officer, I had 'no reasonable expectation' that the old lady in the crosswalk wouldn't move when I ran the red light - I seriously thought she'd get out of the way."  "I had 'no reasonable expectation' that I would hit that other driver because it was late and quite frankly my reasoning skills were no longer good because I had too much to drink."  "I had 'no reasonable expectation' that I would kill you because the odds were 34% in my favor that the gun would not fire."</p>

<p>I'm not saying to hang her, but she needs to pay for this.  She was so far off of the road that she hit him on the driver's side of her car!  Not only should there be a fine, but revoke her license for 25 years - one for each one that Matt Wilheim was alive.  He can't go anywhere, so why should her getting from one point to the other be easy?  Urbana doesn't look that big, if she doesn't want to take the bus she could ride a bike.</p>

<p>Then there's the community service.  She should be spending two evenings a week giving talks on reckless driving and its consequences on top of the 480 hours (the number of hours required if you <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=062500050HCh%2E+11+Art%2E+V&amp;ActID=1815&amp;ChapAct=625%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B5%2F&amp;ChapterID=49&amp;ChapterName=VEHICLES&amp;SectionID=59643&amp;SeqStart=101500&amp;SeqEnd=103100&amp;ActName=Illinois+Vehicle+Code%2E">kill someone while under the influence</a> - Sec. 11&#8209;501.d.2) of community service with a preferred focus on community cycling events and awareness.  </p>

<p>I sympathize with her, she's just screwed herself emotionally for the rest of her life, but that doesn't excuse a slap on the wrist she's been given.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday morning the flurries started.  Dustings appeared wherever there was something to stop the dry snow from blowing around, but as the temperatures rose the snow disappeared.  The snow started up last night and this is what I woke up to this morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/first-snow-in-flagstaff.jpg.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/6039-2/first-snow-in-flagstaff.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>That's looking out the picture window I have in my living room here in Flag.  Sweet view, huh?</p>

        <title>Trails in my backyard</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/11/21/trails_in_my_backyard/"/>
        <updated>2006-11-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/11/21/trails_in_my_backyard</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you sitting down?  Yeah?  Ok...  Yesterday I went for my first mountain bike ride since I moved!  Yeah, I can't hardly believe it either.  Just over three weeks in Flagstaff and I hadn't hoped on a mountain bike once.  It's crazy.  I've been flaking out with the "but my road bike's ready, my mountain bikes need work", but yesterday I headed over to <a href="http://www.azbikes.com/">AZ Bikes</a> and they hooked me up with an <a href="http://www.wtb.com/tires_wtb29er.html">ExiWolf</a> to get my 29'er operational again so no more excuses.</p>

<p>I started out with the intention of riding over to <a href="http://www.flagstaff.az.gov/index.asp?NID=679">Buffalo Park</a> and heading up to the mountains to play, but by the time I got my bike setup and ready to roll it was a little late in the afternoon for that kind of ride.  I knew there was an dirt road that headed out east of town by the country club, so I figured I'd head out that for 30 minutes or so and turn back.  A quarter of a mile out the road, not even out of the view of the houses over there and I come across a National Parks Service sign with saying "<a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/peaks/campbell-mesa-tr.shtml">trailhead - 500 yards</a>".  <em>Sweet!</em>.  I bust up there and apparently there's a network of 11 miles worth of trails that on their south end hook in to <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/passages/pass_31.html">Passage 31</a> of the <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/">Arizona Trail</a>.  <em>Unbelievably sweet</em>!</p>

<p>My last choice of residence was based on proximity to great riding and it turned out that it was basically weekend only riding during the winter because the parks closed at sunset.  The place I'm at now I chose because it was in Flagstaff and it turns out that I'm barely a mile from singletrack, and then barely 5 miles to the Arizona Trail!  Granted, I doubt it'll take the place of Little Bear, or Rocky Ridge up on the mountain, but still it's great to be this close to singletrack where I can get out and stretch my legs when time's tight and it's hopefully low enough that it won't get hit too bad once the snow starts.  Yeah, the Catwalk at 9,000 feet in January is probably not going to be fun, but a few inches down here when you don't have a veritable cliff to one side should still be a blast.</p>

<p>In other news, I started with the race resume submissions today.  Got a letter off to my first pick today, so hopefully something'll work out with 'em.</p>

<p>Just finished getting the garage straightened up.  Now I can pull my car in to the garage again.  Only having a one car garage in Fountain Hills my bikes tended to get priority.  With a two car garage, there's room for all my babies plus my car.  I couldn't have timed it better - tonight there's a chance to snow:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mostly cloudy. Slight chance of rain showers in the evening...then chance of rain and snow showers after midnight. Snow level around 7000 feet after midnight. Southwest winds 10 to 20 mph and gusty in the evening becoming light. Lows 31 to 37. Chance of precipitation 50 percent.</p></blockquote>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow - what a weekend.  I ran out yesterday for lunch and after I came back I grabbed my keys and went to check the mail when Meg reminded me that the mail doesn't run on Sundays.  Working on weekends is definitely not my favorite way to spend a weekend, but it paided off.  <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, my new company, is officially up at running.  The site went live some time after midnight Pacific time last night, and we've already got <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/06/mashery-api-management-service-is-open-for-business/">some</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3885">press</a> along with a handful of links starting to appear under the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mashery">mashery</a> tag on del.icio.us.</p>

<p>One thing that did happen was my release of <a href="http://solarphp.org/wiki/Projects/Domain51#Domain51_Service_Amazon_S3">Domain51_Service_Amazon_S3</a> adapter for Solar (see <a href="http://mail.killersoft.com/pipermail/solar-talk/2006-November/001968.html">announce</a>).</p>

<p>Ok, to you non-programmers that read my site, that will make no sense to you, but you programmer types who know anything about <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> will know exactly what that means: that key is anything but secret.</p>

<p>So where'd I find this gem?  Oh, nowhere in particular, except the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=126&amp;categoryID=47">example page for PHP</a>!  The code in question is not a major issue; it is just a proof of concept after-all.  To be fair the README does say "<em>Note that this program should only be run on a secure server owned by you...</em>", but still.  This is an example that people are going to use to build code off of, so why not do things the correct way?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ugh... my body's tired.  Shoulders hurt, legs hurt, back is numb, hands are raw.  I hate moving...  Especially marathon moving.  Picked up the truck at 8:00 AM, finished unloading it at 7:00 PM.  In between, driving, packing, driving, unpacking.</p>

<p>Today... Qwest support nightmare.  The long and short of it: Qwest with MSN is too damn behind the curve for Linux.  Firefox does IPv6 lookups by default.  MSN's DNS servers choke on IPv6.  I guess Uncle Bill hasn't determined if he can take over IPv6 or not.  Two hours on the phone with support didn't help, but "qwest linux firefox" in Google returned results in less than a second.</p>

<p>But I'm here!  Still have to make a trip back to the valley tomorrow or Tuesday to get the apartment cleaned and turn the keys back in but everything's in Flag now.  Last night when I went out to Beaver Street for some brews and food, I could see the Milky Way just by looking up.  I love it!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few days have given me an opportunity to work on <a href="http://mail.killersoft.com/pipermail/solar-talk/2006-October/001891.html">creating a wrapper</a> to the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/api/">API</a> for the <a href="http:solarphp.com">Solar</a> framework.  In my new job, there's a possibility that I'll be writing a few wrappers for various web services, so I figured I could use this little breather I've had to get some experience doing that.</p>

<p>So far, I haven't written anything of use for this, but I'm thinking I'm going to extend the Solar Bookmarks sample application to include saving all bookmarks to your internal bookmarks and del.icio.us, plus I want to implement the ability to go to del.icio.us and grab a copy of new items that were tagged for you by members of your network.  If you're interested in Solar, or web services, etc., <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/d51Solar/tags/delicious/v0.3/">check out the code</a> and let me know what you think.  It does require <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http">pecl_http</a> to handle it's HTTP requests, though I may refactor that out in a later release.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, it's been so crazy these last few weeks.  I've found it hard to do everything I need to and keep this site up-to-date.  I've got a few minutes downtime right now while I wait for my <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner305/">Forerunner</a> to get some juice to it before I go for a ride.  Rather than do one big post with lots of updates on different topics, I'm going to try to post a few shorter ones this week with updates on the various fronts.  This one's about the new job.</p>

<p>The first of October, I started at <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a> (<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/09/22/big_changes_in_the_air">my job change post</a>).  Now that I've ben there a touch over three weeks, I can say it's been great.  I'm really loving the corporate atmosphere and the group of people I'm working with all are top notch.  One thing this job has allowed me to focus more time on <a href="http://solarphp.com">Solar</a>.</p>

<p>Solar is <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul M. Jones'</a> framework for PHP5.  All in all it's a really good framework.  I've contributed some ideas on the mailing list and am starting to buildup code that I'm contributing in my <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/d51Solar/">svn repo</a>.  I've got a new site that I'm building up using it - I'll post more here once I've got something to show.</p>

<p>Ok, time to go - got some juice in my GPS so I'm off.</p>

<p>A shameless plus, cause I get some money from them too, but if you're looking for a good budget host with a lot of features, I'd definitely <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?238969">recommend them</a>.  If you sign up, be sure to put "<em>TRAVIS50OFF</em>" as the offer code and it'll give you $50 off of whatever hosting you sign up for.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I forgot to mention the coolest part, they offer Jabber servers as part of any of their packages too, so I have a new Jabber (i.e. Google Talk) account: <em>me [at] 2 [dot] 0travis [dot] com</em>.</p>

So it's been official for awhile now, but yesterday's mail made it real!  I'm officially the NMORS state champ and I have the jersey to prove it.</p>

<p>Next year the jersey's going to be tough to defend.  <a href="http://bcowan88.blogspot.com/">Bad Ass Bill's</a> going to be playing with the big boys next year even though he'll just be a senior in high school.  Smokin' Ray's son is coming up from Sport; and sporting a big Maverick bike, Jay'll continue pushing me around the course.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to it.  With the goals I have for myself at the national level, if I meet those I'll be kicking ass at the NMORS next year.</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of posts recently.  With the move and the new job and attempting to be social from time to time I've really been swamped.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This would have been a race to watch.  At least there were cameras there to capture it.  The guys at <a href="http://www.grippedfilms.com/">Gripped Films</a> are working on a documentary on 24 hour racing with Eatough this year.  So for those of you who haven't read the <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb/2006/oct06/24hour_worlds06">race report</a>, I'll summarize: The guy who's won the past 6 24 Hour World Championships, Eatough, was taken out on his 7th attempt.</p>

<p>What makes this amazing is the guy who took him out.  It's Craig Gordon, the Australian Marathon National Champ.  This guy - he's not a professional mountain biker or cyclist for that matter.  According to CyclingNews.com, "...although he is riding under the Bear Naked/Cannondale team banner, Gordon is not actually a professional mountain biker. He works 40 hours a week at a factory near his home in the Sydney suburbs..."  Talk about some inspiration.</p>

<p>Also, notable this: Sue Haywood one her first ever attempt at a 24 hour race.  Not too bad for a Short Track National Champ.  I'm also curious why formal local kid Cameron Chambers pulled after only fifteen and a half hours.  He managed third place even though he didn't race for over 8 of the 24 hours.  Figuring out his time if he would have maintained the same pace through the rest of the race, he would have finished nearly 25 laps compared to the 22 it took to win.  There's no mention of it on the news site though...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Barely it seems some times, but I'm still here.  I spent three great days in Flagstaff last and found a place.  I had hoped for downtown, but after spending two nights down there, I think actually being away from downtown would be nice... kind of noisy.  It's a condo/townhouse over in the country club part of town.  It actually overlooks one of the fairways on the golf course.  It has this great picture window from the living room that frames the San Francisco peaks unbelievably.  I can't wait to get up there...</p>

<p>While I was there, I got in a couple of good rides.  I had to do Mars Hill Wednesday while I rode around town.  Since the first time I went to Flagstaff last September I've wanted to climb that hill.  I hadn't been up there with a road bike and my mountain bike always longed for the mountains so the stars just had never aligned.  Ugh is all I can say.  It actually doesn't seem like that bad of a climb, except I haven't been on a bike that much recently, I definitely wasn't used to the altitude, and they were doing controlled burns west of town so there was a haze over the whole town.  Yikes it hurt.</p>

<p>Thursday was spent house hunting and hanging out, Friday was spent hanging out, riding, and getting the paperwork signed on the place I found.  Friday's ride included a ride out to and up to the Snowbowl.  Considering I haven't done a 6+ mile climb on a road bike at altitude in, well, a few years, I was really happy with my ride.  A around 48 minutes up for 6.5 miles and 2k of climbing.  I'm pleased with it considering how my riding's been going recently.  Based on what my times were on some of the Fountain Hills climbs earlier this year and where they are now, I'm thinking I'm in line for a sub-45 no problem once I'm on form again and possibly pretty damn close to a 40 minute.  I'll post the MotionBased record of the ride as soon as I get around to uploading it.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I leave you with a chicken and spinach lasagna recipe:</p>

<ul><li>6 ounces or so of spinach chopped up (with a knife if you're like me and just like chopping, otherwise the food processor a time or two will do the trick)</li>
<li>Two chicken breasts</li>
<li>Mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan cheese shredded (plus whatever else you want or have in the house)</li>
<li>Half a 15 oz. container of ricotta cheese</li>
<li>One cage-free, all natural (organic if you can) egg - that is the secret to this recipe</li>
<li>Some no-bake lasagna noodles</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Garlic pepper (California style is great, with the crushed red pepper too)</li>
<li>Alfredo sauce - you can cheat and buy it at the store or make your own using <a href="http://wiki.theswicegoods.com/index.php/Chicken_Alfredo">this simple recipe</a></li></ul>

<p>Get a pan (cast iron is great if you're a mountain biker because you're probably anemic from all the blood you loose on the trail) out and coat the bottom (maybe an 1/8th inch) with olive oil; sprinkle in some garlic powder depending on taste, thrown in a chicken breast or two (two works great for a 9" x 9" pan).  You'll want to chop them up once they're done.  While those are cooking, start shreading your cheeses because you know freshly shredded cheese tastes better :-)  In a mixing bowl take your ricotta, mix in the egg and a handful of the various other cheeses you're using.  Stir until it's will mixed.  </p>

<p>Coat your baking pan with butter or a non-stick spray.  Lay down a layer of lasagna noodles, then put your alfredo sauce, mix in some chicken, some of the shredded cheese, and spinach; then another layer of noodles with your ricotta sauce and spinach, then repeat starting with another of the first layers until you've used up all of your ingredients.  Finish it off with some regular slices of mozzarella (enough to cover the top) and just a light sprinkling of spinach.  Cover it, bake at 375 for 45 minutes, then uncover it and bake for another 5 - 10 (depending on how crispy you like your cheese).  Let stand for 5 - 10 minutes (depending on how hungry you are), then chow down with a good glass of wine close at hand.</p>

<p>You can also do the same recipe with a tomato sauce instead of alfredo and any other type of meat you'd like (italian sausage is primo).  The spinach might not go as well with the tomato sauce, but you can drop that if you want.  The cheddar takes away from the truly Italian feel of this, so you might want to drop it with either sauce.  These are going to become regulars at my dinner table.</p>

        <title>Big changes in the air</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/09/22/big_changes_in_the_air</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've received a lot of really positive feedback from my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/09/16/dreaming_up_a_new_life">last post</a>.  Thanks to everybody.  Two of the things I said I wanted to be able to do were to work remote full time and live in Flagstaff.  One of those has happened and I'm working on the other.</p>

<p>This week I accepted an offer a <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, a company that specializes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29">mashups</a> (see <a href="http://oren.blogs.com/praxis/">Oren Michels</a>' <a href="http://oren.blogs.com/praxis/2006/06/introducing_mas.html">Introducing Mashery</a> for more about the company).  I'm really looking forward to working <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul Jones</a> (of <a href="http://solarphp.com/">Solar</a> and <a href="http://phpsavant.com/">Savant</a> fame) again and <a href="http://killersoft.com/">Clay Loveless</a> (of <a href="http://feedster.com/">Feedster</a> and soon-to-be Mashery fame).  Both are great guys and excellent programmers.  This is the second job in a row Paul has been responsible for.  My time at <a href="http://www.uversainc.com/">Uversa</a> came out of a knowing <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> via Paul's Savant, and this job came directly from Paul.  I owe him a beer the next time we're in the same city.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'll be doing web app development still, but it will be remote.  This next week I'm going to spend a few days in Flagstaff trying to find a place to rent.  I'm hoping for a house, but will settle for an apartment/condo again assuming I can get one with a garage for all of my bikes.  Got to take care of the babies.</p>

<p>But this weekend's all about old friends.  I'm heading back out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyover_country">flyover country</a> to visit with some friends.  </p>

        <title>Dreaming up a new life</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/09/16/dreaming_up_a_new_life/"/>
        <updated>2006-09-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/09/16/dreaming_up_a_new_life</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who know me personally - outside of a computer that is - you'll have probably heard me mention <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNew-Psycho-Cybernetics-Maxwell-Maltz%2Fdp%2F0735202850%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1158431397%2Fref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5F1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Psycho-Cybernetics</a>. It was updated and reprinted, but it's original publication date was 1960.  It is the original self-help book.  It practically defined the whole genres.</p>

<p>The 5 minute introduction is thus: your current situation in life - not economically, but emotionally - is based on you.  Your self-image.  Dr. Maltz, the original author, noticed that some patients of his plastic surgery practice would come out of their surgery and be a completely new person, while other's would hold on to the old image of themselves.  The ears could be reduced, the nose improperly set after being broken, straightend; but some people still felt like someone who had big ears or a Frankenstein nose.  He concluded that this was related to the way the person saw themselves, and the original PsychoCybernetics was born.</p>

<p>From there, he realized that your self-image, while deeply ingrained and often subconscious, could be modified by the mental environment you set up for yourself.  Through mental visualization - or as he coined it, the <em>Theater of the Mind</em> - you start to adjust your self-image and change your situation.  The thought (pardon the pun) is that by having an end goal in sight, you will start to find yourself subconsciously and consciously putting yourself in positions to make that goal a reality.</p>

<p>Every athlete that's been at their sport for any length of time will be familiar with this.  Mental practice, the mental game, the game between the ears.  All things we're used to hearing.  My  best races have always come after the proper mental preparation.  I had been through what was going to happen so often that I already knew the outcome of the race.  I would stay focused, calmly react to anything that was thrown my way, and put in the best effort I could that day.</p>

<p>So this morning, after a good hour on the road bike, I walked to the store to pick up some food for lunch.  While walking across the street, I started thinking that I'm in a place where I want a change.  The Psycho-Cybernetics in me kicked in and I started imagining what I want that life to be.  The rest of this post is just that.  I'm not sure how I'll get to that end, but the first step is identifying where I'm going.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I want to live in the mountains.  Plain, simple, and something I keep coming back to.  Every time I've been in Flagstaff this year, I've left thinking "this is where I should be".  It doesn't necessarily have to be Flag, but right now that seems like the most realistic option.</p>

<p>In the mountains, I'm torn between two places to live.  One, I would love to have a place on the outskirts of town with an acre or two.  A nice old-growth pine forest for the lot, and a cabin.  It has to have a wood burning stove to provide the majority of the heat.  I'm not thinking rustic, something that's comfortable and uses technology, but doesn't overpower you with it.</p>

<p>The other option in a town like Flagstaff would be to live near the center of the old downtown.  It would be great to find an unconverted loft with 2,000 - 3,000 sq. ft. of open space to make into a home.  Oh, and it would have to have an old freight elevator - the kind with the guard across it instead of a real closing door - to get to the upstairs.  Big windows on one side would be a necessity; with a view of the mountains or the town.</p>

<p>Once I'm there, I want a simple lifestyle.  Working remote almost all the time so I'm working from home would be perfect.  I hate commuting, unless it's being used as a good reason to ride a bike.  I'll get up early in the morning, start on the morning's work.  Mid-day, I'd take off for a few hours to get a ride in.  After coming back and showering and eating, I'd get started back up on the late-afternoon's work.  </p>

<p>I'll keep that up until that evening when I start supper.  I'd fix my own meals every week night and relegate eating out to weekends or special occassions.  I love eating out.  Good food, good atmosphere, and almost always good company, but I really love cooking.  Spending 30 - 45 minutes a day fixing a meal is therapy for me.  It's calming, centering.  Spending that time cooking with someone else is better than therapy.</p>

<p>The springs will be spent preparing for the upcoming racing season.  Getting in good base miles and starting to up my intensity.  As the summer comes in, I'll start spending time on the road or in the air heading out to the major races.  After a few years of spending time at altitude, racing back east even with all the humidity will seem easy and I'll finally be able to put in the effort I know I'm capable of when I'm racing with the big boys in Colorado and Utah.</p>

<p>The fall will be spent riding for fun.  Group rides, weeking camping trips with my B.O.B. Trailer in tow, playing on the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/bike-harem/standing-strong-bullit.jpg.html">big bike</a>.  I'll also get in some good camping trips, even if it is just thirty minutes from where I live.  This will be the transition period from a hard season of racing as I just reconnect to just having fun on the bike and outdoors.</p>

<p>The winter will be spent snow-shoeing and cross country skiing.  That'll help with the cardio and serve as good base building for the next racing season.  I'll take up downhill skiing too just for fun and to help with my coordination.  No, that's a lie.  I'll do it just to give my mother one more thing to worry about! :-)  And you can't forget the ski-bike.  I'll have to have one of those, maybe two.  One that's set up for XC with some sort of propulsion, and another that's set for downhill.</p>

<p>I'll spend a few days every few weeks living out of a hotel or crashing at friend's places in a warmer climate so I can get some good training in on the bike and make sure my legs remember how to work for the next year's racing season.  Speaking of racing season, I'll have my pro card and be able to race at that level.  I might not be winning at that level I'll be holding my own.</p>

<p>I'll have a fireplace that's the focal point of my living room, not my TV.  Some big comfy chairs and my comfy couch will surround it with blankets to curl up in while I'm reading.  In the winters, there will be a perpetual kettle on the stove for tea and hot chocolate and extra blankets in the closets for the beds so you fall asleep feeling the weight of 5 blankets push you in to sleep.  In the summers, the house will be laid out that you rarely - if ever - use the AC.  Just open the windows and a cool breeze will keep the house cool.  The fresh air will be good for my lungs and I'll have finally gotten rid of this allergy crap that's been bugging me since I moved to Phoenix.</p>

<p>I'll need two rooms with a view.  One for my office.  The view will help keep me inspired, realizing the "work" I do is to give me this life style and to provide inspiration.  I work better when I can take a few seconds every now and then and just look aimlessly outside and watch the world move by.  A few deep breaths and 30 seconds of watching the bushes or trees sway or traffic drive down the road and I'm recentered.</p>

<p>The second one is for an art room.  There will be a desk with a computer, but a computer that's just used for art projects: photography processing, printing, finding inspiration, etc., etc.  There'll be a drawing table that is kept clear except for the pad of paper and the rack of pencils I'll keep handy and use on a regular basis.  I might take up painting.  If I do, there'll be an easel in the room with all my painting supplies within reach.  I'll keep my guitar in this room and keep it out of the case because I'm playing again.  The case will become decoration and I'll only use it if I'm taking my guitar somewhere.  My piano will also be set up and I'll have finally started the lessons to learn how to play jazz piano.</p>

<p>I'll live a pedestrian life style.  My car will be used sparingly, only on big trips out of town or when I'm going to the store and need to buy a lot.  I'll be involved in the town; know what's going on, attend a few town council meetings even.  I'll get involved in another IMBA group that's as good and active as <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/">ER</a> or help get one to that point.  I'll start building and maintaining trails again.</p>

<p>I'll start devoting a set amount of time each week to open source software.  There's a few pet projects that I have that I'd like to get out of the idea stage and there's always existing projects that can use a hand.  I'll make time for these so they become something I do instead of believe in.</p>

<p>I'll start taking a few classes at a local university or college, or maybe online.  I'll focus on history, like my original plan was back in '99.  The degree won't be the end goal, but if I get there great.</p>

<p>Finally, I'll have someone to share all of this with.  Maybe they're not crazy about this whole plan, but they'll like that I'm crazy enough to dream it all up on a lazy Saturday.</p>

<p>So there's the manifesto for my life.  The way I want it to be.  I know it's not all going to happen at once or next week.  Hell, I even know that it's not all going to happen at the same time, there's just too much there I want to do.  But that's where I want to be...  That's <em>who</em> I want to be.  I'm sure it will be an evovling goal, so this post might just get updated.</p>

<p>Next step, figuring out how to start moving toward this goal.</p>

        <title>Weekend in the mountains</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/09/11/weekend_in_the_mountains/"/>
        <updated>2006-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/09/11/weekend_in_the_mountains</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, what a weekend.  Saturday morning I got up and packed up for a weekend of camping up in Flagstaff.  This makes for two weekends in a row sleeping in a tent, but this weekend I went without the big group.  No offense guys, but having just a nice mellow weekend at my pace instead of the "go go go" that city folk want with camping was nice.</p>

<p>Saturday I left mid-morning to drive the back way up to Flag.  As I headed out of town, I saw a massive storm that I had seen on the radar early heading across the mountains to block my way to Payson.  When I hit the storm, there were times where I couldn't see more than a hundred yards in front of me.  Rain in the desert in the monsoon season is crazy.  With a quick stop at the Payson Home Depot for some <a href="http://www.envirolog.com/">Enviro-logs</a>, I hit the road to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine,_Arizona">Pine</a> for lunch.  There is a little tiny Mexican food hole-in-the-wall (who's name escapes me) that I stopped for an enchilada.  Good food, but half way through this weird air raid siren went off.  I say weird because it didn't remind me of the normal air raid siren I'm used to from my time in Kansas City.  Turns out they have a siren that they sound at noon every day to mark the mid-day.</p>

<p>Back on the road, the rain has completely stopped now and the roads were dry; it's time to finish climbing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogollon_Rim">Mongollon Rim</a>.  If you haven't driven this stretch of road in Arizona, this is worth the drive.  The views are unbelievable and if you're like me and love driving on twisty, turny, mountain roads you will absolutely love this road.  I've been up twice now, and both times I wish there was more of a shoulder to work with.  It would be such a fun ride on a road bike, but there's practically no shoulder.  During the week the traffic should be light enough to handle a ride without much issue, but I feel like I'd be pushing it on a weekend.  Of course, I did see two guys pedaling their pannier laden bikes up Highway 87 past the rim summit, so they must have done it themselves.  One of these days...</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/2006-09-08-camping-weekend/IMG_4398-001-sm.jpg.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/6005-2/IMG_4398-001-sm.jpg" class="imgLeft" /></a>From there it was up to Flag to find a campground.  I decided to start checking campgrounds at <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/mormon_lake/index.shtml">Mormon Lake</a>.  Coming up from the south, you go through the village of Mormon Lake.  I love it.  Well, I can't say that I love it because I've never stopped and gone in any of the stores or anything like that, but any town that has a city limits sign that lists their population as "50 to 5,000" has to be cool.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake">lake</a> is really down this year.  According to the guy manning the campground, it's only 2' deep in the deepest areas right now!  So the lake wasn't very impressive, but from Mormon Lake village, you had an unbelievable view of these poppy-like flowers.  I say "poppy-like" becaues they remind me of the poppies that used to bloom from time to time on the Franklin Mountains in El Paso.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/2006-09-08-camping-weekend/IMG_4329-sm.JPG.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/6002-2/IMG_4329-sm.JPG" class="imgRight" /></a>I settled on the Dairy Springs campground.  The site I had was beautiful, and the view out of my tent's doors were unbelievable.  There's nothing like upper 60s, low 70s and old growth pine forests to win me over.  Staying about 30 minutes south of Flag also meant that for the camping part of the trip, I didn't have to put up with the crowds that a lot of the places closer in to town have to put up with.</p>

<p>After setting up camp and taking a 45 minute hike, I headed in to town for libations and nurishment.  I paid homage at <a href="http://www.beaverstreetbrewery.com/">Beaver Street Brewery</a>; a place that is quickly becoming a standard of my trips to Flag.  After that was a trip to the <a href="http://www.lowell.edu/">Observatory</a> to check out the evening's program and look through some telescopes.  The program was their standard late-summer program, but they had the telescopes set up to view a couple of different things.  The smaller refractor telescope was setup early in the evening viewing Jupiter until it set.  Everyone who got there early got to check it out.  It was still twilight, so you could just make out the cloud patterns and of course the four largest moons.  The <a href="http://www.lowell.edu/AboutLowell/clark.html">Clark</a> was setup on <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m015.html">M15</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/2006-09-08-camping-weekend/IMG_4375-001-sm.jpg.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/6007-2/IMG_4375-001-sm.jpg" class="imgLeft" /></a>After checking out the sights to be seen from Mars Hill, I headed back to a warm fire (though it did take longer to light than it should have) and a comfy sleeping bag for the night.  The next morning, I woke up about 30 minutes before sunrise to the sound of elk bugling.  It was unbelievable.  I spent the morning relaxing by the fire before heading back in to Flagstaff.  </p>

<p>After getting back in to Flag, I realized that's where I want to be.  Phoenix is a cool enough (well, not literally) city, but it's a big city that's discombobulated.  Fountain Hills is a cool enough little suburb, but it's a 'burb.  I'm 20 - 30 mintues from anywhere I want to be and I can easily drive for an hour before I get out of the valley.  I want something smaller.  I want something in the mountains.  I want something with that cool college town vibe.  I think Flagstaff and I make a great match.</p>

<p>Found the perfect place in the paper about 1 PM Sunday afternoon.  The only problem was that someone else found it too and was already looking at the property before I called about it.  Two and a half acres with a 3 bedroom place out by the Snow Bowl.  Would have been awesome for me, and I'm sure it will be for someone else too.  Anyhow, I'm on the look out now for a place to rent.  It seems that houses are cheaper than apartments/condos, so I might end up with a house.  With a big enough place or not, if I get moved that means Thanksgiving and Christmas are in the mountains for all of your city dewellers here in Phoenix.  It also means that I might be hitting a few of you up for a couch or floor space for a couple of nights every couple of weeks to get I'm away from the cold and snow to train. :-)</p>

<p>Props to "Big" Dave Wilson for having the balls to do it.  Yup, those same balls that are there for all the world to see.  I've got a few emails from him the past few days.  He's back in the Army now and said the vibe sucks.  No one wants to be there except a few nut cases who're pissed because they can't get a deployment to Iraq.  What's wrong with this picture?  The guys who want to go to Iraq are pissed because they have to stay behind and corral the ones who don't want to go.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Contrary to the comments on my site, I'm not dead nor have I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/08/28/race_report_new_mexico_state_championshi#c7502">given up on blogging</a> because I feel it beneath me.  Seriously, female <a href="http://www.leftof.net/">friends</a> <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/index.php">and</a> <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/index.php">family</a> can be rough!  It's just been a busy few weeks.</p>

<p>Got back from the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/08/28/race_report_new_mexico_state_championshi">Cruces race</a> and felt bad.  The race in the heat and then the 6 hour drive home right after it didn't do me any good.  I decided to take it easy for a few days.  A few days turned in to a week, turned into nearly two.  I haven't been on a bike since Cruces.  Then to top things off, this morning I wake up with a bit of a sore throat.  Didn't I already do this?  Aren't doctor's visits supposed to fix these things?</p>

<p>I went camping last weekend with some friends from work.  It was great fun, but more hectic than I like my camping outings to be.  I have had every intention of going up to Flagstaff (or somewhere around there) this weekend and camping my style, back in the national forest away from campgrounds and other people.  The plan was to setup camp Friday afternoon or Saturday morning, hit Flagstaff Saturday evening for food and a trip to the Observatory, then back to the camp for some relaxation on through Sunday until I broke camp and headed home.  If this sore throat doesn't get out of here I'll be spending the weekend camped out at home, in bed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=%2FStupid-Contagious-Caprice-Crane%2Fdp%2F0446695726%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1157669628%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks">Stupid and Contagious</a> and something to drink.</p>

<p>Oh, in case it isn't obvious, I'm not doing the <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org/calendar.htm">Red River</a> race this weekend.  I'm thinking I'm done for year.  I'll probably do the <a href="http://www.roadapplerally.com/">Road Apple</a> then go play at some of the local races later in November, but other than that I'm starting to think of '07 now.</p>

        <title>Race Report: New Mexico State Championship - Horny Toad Hustle</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/08/28/race_report_new_mexico_state_championshi/"/>
        <updated>2006-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/08/28/race_report_new_mexico_state_championshi</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chalk another one up in the win column.  I officially took first place at the New Mexico State Championship race, though it's kind of hollow.  Another win by default, there's just no racers in the 19-29 Expert this year.  Next though, that's when it's going to be fun.  <a href="http://bcowan88.blogspot.com/">Bill</a> will be racing with the big boys, and Michael is planning on upgrading now that he's been on the podium at the last two Sport races.  Should be all kinds of fun.</p>

<p>So the actual race.  During the warm up, I could feel that my legs weren't going to be in it.  I put in a few hard, five minute efforts.  My legs were ok, but I could feel they weren't going to stick around.  When I got my race number Sunday morning, Angie told me that I was the only one that had pre-registered.  "Ok," I thought, "the other guys will be registering this morning."  When registration closed, I went and asked if anyone else had registered, and sure enough I was on my own.  That changed my plan for the day.</p>

<p>I decided I was going to go out and see how I felt.  I'd put in a steady effort for 10 - 15 minutes and if I felt good I'd keep at it, if not I'd just start cruising.  The course started with a two mile jeep road climb.  The Pros kicked it up from the start and took off.  I was just taking it easy through the first wash until we got on the road, then I picked up the pace.  I picked off 10 or more riders just setting a nice 90% - 95% pace.  We hit the single track and I lost a few spots and just wasn't feeling it.  After middle-ringing nearly the entire climb up, I knew I wasn't going to be putting in any unbelievable performance, so I just backed off for a leisurely Sunday ride.</p>

<p>One of the guys from Cruces that pre-rode the course said he did the long loop in two hours just cruising.  I felt pretty good when I came through at 1:30 after cruising the last 2/3rd of the course.  I went out for my second lap just cruising along the whole lap and put in a time near 1:40 for a total time right at 3:11.  </p>

<p>There's a rule that the promoter can shorten an advertised race, and I tried to get Justin to invoke it for me being sick and all, but he had no pity on me and made me do two laps.  The cold from last week came up and tightened my breathing during that first lap.  The harder I went the harder it was to breath.  I could feel my legs starting to burn with the lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>I don't know how I would have finished if I would have been racing someone.  It's hard to be motivated when there's no one you have to race against.  Well, the thought of nearly 6 hours on the road dead because you left it all out on the course doesn't help your motivation any either.</p>

<p>Given the amount of time I've spent on a bike the last few weeks and especially the last week (nothing since two Thursday's ok), I'm pleased with how I felt on the bike.  I ate well, drank well, and had a decent endurance.  Didn't have a ton of power, but that didn't surprise me coming off of the cold.</p>

<p>The actual course was great.  It's classic Chihuahuan desert mountain bike racing.  Always rocky or sandy and sometimes both.  Every time you think you've finished climbing, the course turned up again.  Hot (low 90s by 10).  Technical, and so much fun to ride.  I'm certain that if you can ride well in the desert, you can ride anywhere in the country on any type of trail and handle your bike with confidence.</p>

<p>On a sort of related topic, my initial calculations put this as the race that throws me over the top for the <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org/index.htm">NMORS</a> series title for <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org/results/2006-NMORS/standings.asp?Series=NMORS&amp;Year=2006&amp;Category=ExpertM19-29&amp;Gender=Men">Expert 19 -29</a>.  After yesterday's race, I'll have 122 points.  There's only three races left, and the closest to me in the race for points is Jay with 38 (last week's Signal Peak Challenge isn't posted on the results site yet).  If he sweeps the series from here out he'll have 113.  So on paper, I pulled in another of my goals for the season.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sorry Eric, but this is just too damn funny...</p>

<blockquote><p>I DON'T KNOW WHO TRAVIS SWICEGOOD IS AND AT THIS POINT DON'T CARE TO KNOW. I ATTEMPTED IN GOOD FAITH TO POST A COMMENT TO HIS SITE ON RICK MATHES AND HAD THAT SILLY QUESTION ...WHAT COLOR IS BLACK....TO RESPOND TO....DID NOT REALIZE THIS IS A JOKE SITE FOR BIZARE WARPED SENSE OF HUMORS. YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND ME PERSONALLY. GET ON YOUR BIKE AND RIDE INTO THE SUNSET AND LEAVE COMPUTERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE QUASI INTELLIGENT. THANK YOU</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, his original email was entirely in caps-lock, and yes, this dude emailed me pissed off that he couldn't figure out what color black was so he could respond to one of my responses to Rick Mathes (search Google for it and look for my name on the first page).  Now, I know <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/">Matt</a> takes issue with that question stating that (and technically, correctly) black is devoid of all color, so is therefore not a color, but wow.  </p>

<p>The sad part, I actually responded to him earlier in the week and told him he was trying to make this too hard and that black is, well black.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Can I have Blatently Obvious to Chimpanzees for $100?  </p>

<p>This "color" is devoid of all color and generally referred to as black.  </p>

<p>*ring ring ring* Alex, what is Black?  </p>

<p>Correct!  </p>

<p>Can I have Blatently Obvious to Chimpanzees for $200?  </p>

<p>Two of this, the first non-zero even number equal four.</p>

<p>*ring ring ring* What is two?  </p>

<p>Correct, and you've won the right to call yourself the homo sapien!</p></blockquote><p>At least he was courteous.  He did say thank you, or at least yell it anyway.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, I can't wait.  I've dropped three races this month for various reasons (I really did plan on dropping one), but now I'm ready.  I still have a bit of lingering chest congestion, but it's 93.8% better than it was last Saturday.</p>

<p>This weekend is the <a href="http://www.hornytoadhustle.org/">New Mexico State Championship - aka Horny Toad Hustle</a>.  Top 15 in my age slot gets me an automatic entry in to Nationals.  I'll be surprised if there's 5 in my category.  The cool thing, there's some nice moola involved in this one for the Experts.  I could walk away with $75 to $125 which definitely helps with expenses.</p>

<p>I haven't been on a bike since Thursday of last week, so today and tomorrow are either going to be unbelievable because I'm so well rested, or they're going to suck.  This morning, I'm leaning toward the unbelievable.  I love getting ready to head to a race feeling this good about it.  :D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, I hated to do it, but my chest and head was not up for Signal Peak at Silver City.  I hate that too, because that's one of the more fun courses in the NMORS.  Oh well, next weekend is the more important race as it's the qualifier for '07 Nationals.  Not that qualifying is going to be a big deal, the top 15 finishers in each class get to go, and so far there's been two races without a single 19 - 29 Expert racing.  Sad that racings coming to that.</p>

<p>Back to the cold, this feels an awful lot like the cold I picked up January/February.  After trying to kick it for a few weeks, I finally went into the doctor and got an allergy shot which took care of it.  Given how my chest felt so tight yesterday, I'm wondering if this isn't some borderline asthmatic thing.  Anyhow, I've made up my mind.  If this isn't gone Monday, I'm getting another shot.  It's just not worth fiddling with trying to kick it like I did earlier in the year.  Especially when the shot means I feel 100% better in about 48 hours.</p>

Not the "I swalloed wrong" kind, but the "something's in my chest" kind.  By the time I went to sleep it had progressed into something bigger.  Vicks and vitamin time.</p>

<p>This morning, I woke up from an awesome dream, but my upper chest feels like someones pushing down on it and I've still got the cough.  Not good...  And the weekend of the Signal Peak race in Silver City of all times!  That's one of the more fun races in the series.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I came in and sat down at the computer to start work on mapping out my training for the rest of the season.  Just a few minutes into it, I thought I heard a dog growling.  This wasn't a low friendly, get out of my way or else growl, but something more guttural.  That kind of growl that's in response to being pushed; the "I don't want to do this, but if you make me" kind of growl.  At first I thought someone might just be playing rough with their dog - I've heard some pretty mean sounding dogs when they're just playing.</p>

<p>Then I heard it again.  It dawned on me that didn't sound like something coming from inside the building, it sounded like it was coming from outside my window.  I headed out to the balcony, and as I walked out and started looking down in the arroyo that my balcony overlooks I heard it again, followed by a flurry of activity.  Through the bushes, I could see something taking off toward the street with two something's chasing it.  I couldn't make out what took off, but the two somethings looked an awful lot like javalina.</p>

<p>A split second later, a coyote popped out of the arroyo and started looking back to where I had just heard all the commotion.  Then I got my confirmation of what was chasing him, I started hearing teeth click.  This kept up for a few minutes, the coyote having a truly astonished look on his face.  If he would have had digits, I'm sure he would have been scratching his head.  After the javalina started to calm down and two of them (one of the older ones and the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/16/how_cool_is_this">younger one I took a picture of before</a>), the coyote took the round about way back down into the arroyo.  There was some more clicking - apparently one stayed behind - and growling, then he popped back out and trotted off.</p>

<p>Now I'm curious what's down there.  The one javalina stayed pretty wounded up for the coyote to be 20 feet away and acting like he was trying to stay out of their way.  I never heard any yelping, and if there's one thing I know about coyotes it's that they are extremely vocal little critters.  If a javalina would have pinned on of them, people 4 blocks away would have known about it.  And the javalina generally aren't meat eaters so they would be trying to run a coyote off of a kill or anything.</p>

<p>And sorry, no pictures this time.  I came back in to get my camera as soon as I saw all of the action start up, but I had it on the other side of the apartment.  I was afraid of missing something, so I had to stay and watch.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Taken directly from the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/results/Series_2006.shtml">horse's mouth</a>:<br />
<img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/5975-2/2006-NORBA-Marathon-Series-Standings-Final.jpg" /></p>

<p>It's official now, I get to claim the 2006 19 - 29 NORBA Marathon Series title.  Sweet. :)</p>

<p>Today and tomorrow my plan is to start a rough map through the end of next July.  I know the big race date for next year: Nationals at Mount Snow the 19 - 22 of July.  The weekend after that is Sugar Mountain in <abbr title="North Carolina">NC</abbr>.  Sugar Mountain will hopefully be icing on the cake.  Looking at Big Dave's results in Brian Head last weekend, I've got a lot of catching up to do if I want to be a mid-pack Semi-Pro by '08.  He went all the way to July before he even lost of national race in the Experts this year and even at that hadn't finished below 4th.  Got low-20s in the Semi-Pro race.  And he can easily put 10 minutes or so into me in a two hour race.  At least I have someone that I race against on a semi-regular basis early in the season to test myself against.</p>

<p>So the big reason for starting to map out the season is that I have to reign myself in.  I haven't had a really good day on the bike since Nationals.  They've all been sluggish at best.  I'm putting in good times; I'm just not feeling it.  I think diet's part of the issue, but I also think late-May/June's training was another.  I put in some really intense blocks of training a few weeks too early and peaked before those races.  I tried to hold on to the fitness toward the end of June and just drug it out too long.  Looking at the season I have in front of me, if I do race the Arizona series, my season will start the end of January and basically run until July with no more than 3 weeks off at a time.  I'm going to have to be smart about it if I'm going to make it to July in the condition I need to be in and still be able to put in some decent efforts early in the season at a few of the MBAA races to get the points needed to win that series.  Hopefully, a few of the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/">NMBS</a> races will coincide with the local series so I can group them together.</p>

<p>Quick shout out to NM racer, Glen Gollrad.  Pulled in a 2nd place at the Expert 30+ Short Track up in Aspen this weekend.  And Big Dave pulled a 14th in the Semi-Pro XC.  <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/results/NMBS7_2006.shtml">More results</a> will be posted as the races are run.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sweet!  I just looked at the results from the Brian Head marathon, and according to my calculations I took the series title!!  :D</p>

<p>I didn't race this weekend and have been keeping my fingers crossed that the one possible scenario that could cost me the title if I didn't race didn't happen.  Looks like it didn't, so I'll take the title by 180 points!</p>

<p>Goals for the season:</p>
<ul><li>Stars and stripes jersey - nope, bad luck and a better racer took it from me</li>
<li>19 - 29 NORBA Marathon Series title - check</li>
<li>New Mexico Off-Road Series Title - <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org/results/2006-NMORS/standings.asp?Series=NMORS&amp;Year=2006&amp;Category=ExpertM19-29&amp;Gender=Men">on my way...</a></li></ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My mountain bike and I have an appointment with some dirt, so I'll keep this short.  Just wanted to congratulate two of my co-workers and friends <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> and <a href="http://www.leftof.net/">Megan</a> as they tie the knot after nine years of trying to figure out if they are right for each other.  :)</p>

<p>So have you ever had "balance issues" after a glass of wine and trying to shave your legs in the shower?  Yeah, me neither...</p>

        <title>Open letter to Pat Forde of ESPN.com</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/27/open_letter_to_pat_forde_of_espn_com/"/>
        <updated>2006-07-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/27/open_letter_to_pat_forde_of_espn_com</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In response to Pat's <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/columns/story?id=2531597">article</a> on ESPN.com about dopping and sports, I sent him the following email.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Pat,</p>

<p>Your <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/columns/story?id=2531597">article</a> that's on ESPN.com right now is spot on and in light of the recent events has a reserved amount of skepticism.  However, I want to invite you to see a hundred or so clean "professional" athletes competing in Utah next weekend (Aug 5 - 6).  Next week is the 6th race in the National Mountain Bike Series (NMBS) at Brian Head, Utah.</p>

<p>There will be a hundred or so athletes competing in the Pro and Semi-Pro fields that are technically competing as professional athletes, though the majority of them earn their paycheck from some other source.  These are people who are professionals because they love their sport, not because that's how they're making their millions.  In the mountain biking world, it's considered a pretty good deal if you're getting your bike for free, and you've got to be one of the top 5 to even think about getting any money from sponsors.  The national level in Pro events don't even pay the winners.  These pros put in the long, hard, and often times, lonely hours in the off season preparing their bodies to be pushed to their absolute limits when that A race comes along.</p>

<p>So you want a few clean athletes?  Show up in Utah next weekend.  Talk to people about Ryan "Treefarm" Trebon's attack at the national championship.  He went so early that everybody thought he was suicidal.  He held it, though, to be the first person to take the national championship away from Jeremy Horgan-Kobelski in four or five years.  Find out about Georgia Gould, who after only 3 years of racing as a pro became the wearer of the stars and stripes in the women's pro XC.  Talk to Travis Brown and Chris Eatough and how their nearly 5 hour marathon race came down to the last five miles of a 60 mile race.</p>

<p>Better yet, come talk to the people who weren' standing atop the podiums.  Dara Marks Marino and her fight back from 10th place to 4th after she flatted while in the lead on the first lap of the women's pro XC.  Or Jennifer Wilson who works as a teacher during the school year and every summer travels the country with her husband doing the NMBS.  She had her career best finish, 6th place.  Talk to the dad in the feed zone who's there watching his daughters race for only the second time this year because "he's going broke trying to help her reach her dream".</p>

<p>So yeah, there are a lot of dirty athletes out there, but for everyone one of them, there's a dozen that would die to have their talent and their opportunity, but would do it cleanly.  A lot of them will be in Utah next week.  Sometimes you just have to look past the L'Alpe D'Huezes and manicured grasses of the AT&amp;T Parks of the world.</p>

        <title>I needed tonight</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/27/i_needed_tonight/"/>
        <updated>2006-07-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/27/i_needed_tonight</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tuesday was my return to the bike.  This afternoon (yes, this afternoon in Phoenix in July!) I wanted to get some hill repeats in on the road bike.  The weather was perfect.  Upper-80s, low-90s, perfect.  A little muggy, but it was 110+, so I'll take it.</p>

<p>As I head out, my legs feel like crap.  I have a 15 minute warm up with a few steep climbs thrown in before I hit the Kingstree/Palomino climb.  This is my benchmark climb that I use for all testing to figure out how I'm progressing.  It's roughly 4 miles long and covers 650'.  At the base there's a 100 yard climb that touches 16%.  Then it levels off for for about a half mile at 2%, followed just a touch under 3 miles at 4%, with a final half mile or so that's got a few short 10% grades and probably averages around 7%.</p>

<p>I start at the bottom, my legs feel sluggish.  I'm already starting the think about my post this evening.  "Well, my top end power has really tappered off after Nationals.", "I'm sure it'll be back by the end of August in time for the New Mexico State Championship" etc., etc.  I hit the first steep climb, known around here as the Kingstree.  My <abbr title="heart rate">HR</abbr> spikes.  A month or so ago I was hitting the top of that climb and barely getting over 185.  Tonight I hit 199!  Ok, ouch.  Pull back just a bit, focus on your breating, bring your HR down.  I got it down a bit, but just under 190.</p>

<p>My <abbr title="personal record">PR</abbr> up this climb is 15:41.  I start thinking how this time is going to suck.  It'll be 17+.  I blow through my first time check and don't even look at the lap time.  I start up the second leg of the climb where it picks up a bit.  I'm still in my little ring about mid way through the cassette.  Normally I'm rocking the big ring through this second, but I'm off of it.  There's a long straight section with right hander at the end.  I hit that and decide to look at my lap time.  9 minutes and changes.  Man, I'd have to be flying to hit the second check around 12:20 - 12:30 I think to myself.</p>

<p>The way I ride this climb, I push up the first steep climb.  Recover, then get a good tempo on the second leg, then push hard for the last section.  Normally I'm trying to keep it in the big ring on the last section and keep a good spin going.  I never even got into my big ring tonight.  I'm rolling along and hit the second timecheck, 12 minutes and umpteen seconds!  Wow, I've only been under 12:20 once before!</p>

<p>Now I hit the final section.  Still in the little ring, but now I realize I might just have a shot at a descent time.  I'm keeping a good sping on the climb, but my legs are way over <abbr title="lactate threshold">LT</abbr> and my HR is over 200 now.  I think I'm going to crack any minute, but I didn't.  I rolled to the top of the climb at the turn around, hit my lap timer, and rolled at 15 minute, low 20 something time!  Sweet!</p>

<p>My HR topped out at 205 <abbr title="beats per minute">BPM</abbr>, which is what I've registered as my max before.  My HR is high, but the few times I've taken time off of the bike this year, I've noticed my HR spikes after the time off.  My perceived effort stays the same, but my heart works a bit harder.</p>

<p>So, I was expecting a big drop off on my power after a week and a half off of the bike.  Looks like that's not the case.  Now I just need to focus on getting some distance miles in on the bike so my HR isn't through the roof while I'm riding.</p>

<p>I'm planning on a road ride Saturday morning, followed by some singletrack adventures in Flagstaff on Sunday.  I'm thinking Weatherford this time.  I don't know how far up you can take a bike, but I know the trail tops out well over 10k.</p>

<p>:(</p>

<p>Sorry I haven't posted more here recently; been busier than normal.  Tuesday ended a week and a half off of the bike (except for a few 30 minute spins).  Felt good, but was slow.  I was planning on hill intervals on the road bike this morning, but woke up to lightning and rain?!  This afternoon maybe?  A cold front is moving through, so it's only going to be in the upper 90s :)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night while I was driving over to a hang out with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mahoover">Megan</a> and <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2">All Things Considered</a>.  This past week they've had a multi-part series on the Brook Army Medical Center, the military's one burn center.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5573767">Last night's story</a> was on Sgt. Joe Fowler.  I'm sort of the emotional type anyhow (thanks, Mom), but this one really got to me.  He's a mountain biker.  My goals for the year on my bike include winning the national marathon series title, the stars and stripes (can't check that one off this year), and winning the NM series.  His goals for the year?  Having enough grip in his hands that he can ride a bike again by the end of the year.  </p>

<p>Makes my goals seem kind of silly...  </p>

The Landis team kit in New Mexico stuck out this past May when racing in Gallup.  The girl who hit her is from a family of cyclists, so it isn't one of those random I hate cyclists things.  Her <a href="http://obits.abqjournal.com/results?obit_id=80522">obituary</a> memorializes what sounds like a full life.  It's too bad it was cut short.</p>

        <title>Women's pro national championship</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/18/women_s_pro_national_championship/"/>
        <updated>2006-07-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/18/women_s_pro_national_championship</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I said I would elaborate a bit on the women's pro race.  The course was the same as the marathon, except they were doing three laps to our seven/eight laps.  There were two feed zones.  I manned the first one for Jen Wilson and Dave, her husband manned the second for Jen, <a href="http://www.daramarksmarino.com/">Dara</a>, and a couple of other girls.  This allowed everyone to have two bottles of water or mix a lap while only having to carry one at a time.  Worked really well for them.</p>

<p>The course started with 200 yards or so of pavement, then a sharp turn and up through the feed zone as they hit the first climb of the day.  To my non-racing readers, there's generally two groups of racers in the women's pro races.  The one's who are just getting started (or just aren't improving) and the top 25 or so who are really good.  Going through the feed zone, someone in that back group got tangled up with another rider and three rider's went down.  Jen had started on the last row, but had made it to mid-pack so she was literally just in front of the wreck.  Everyone kept moving forward from there, so I don't think that ended anyone's day immediately.  But what a way to crash out of the national championship... 45 seconds into the race and not out of sight of the start/finish line and someone falls into you.</p>

<p>Nearly 40 minutes passed and the two leaders came through.  <a href="http://daramarksmarino.com/">Willow</a> and <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/team/rider_bio.asp?rider=irmiger">Heather</a> (both <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/team/">Fisher</a> riders) had got off of the front.  The course had a lot of road sections where two riders could work together to get a sizeable gap on the rest of the field.  At that point, barring any issues, I figured Fisher had a one two locked up.  The other rider's started coming through.  Dara came through the line in 6th I believe.  As she came through, she kept looking to the pits like she was looking for something.  I was thinking "wait, the feed zone is on this side".  She was looking for her wheels.  In the only rock garden in the whole course, she had pinched while in an attack off of the front with Heather.</p>

<p>I wanted to help, but within 30 seconds of her coming through the line I heard them announce "and here's Jennifer Wilson of El Paso, Texas".  Whoa!  Jen's riding within a minute of Dara!  I almost couldn't believe it.  A quick check over the fence back at the start/finish and sure enough, it was Jen with another racer hauling.  She came through the feed zone, grabbed her water and I told her she was doing awesome.  She had come through in eighth place!  Dara, with the help of a few of the other guy's working the pit had got her wheel swapped out and was back out on the course in ninth.</p>

<p>Saying I was excited for Jen is an understatement.  The previous week, she had been in Deer Valley pretty bummed about another 22nd place finish.  That was her 4th 22nd finish of the year - in four straight national races.  She was consistently with the faster racers, but just not toward the top part of it.  She came through the feed zone smiling and looking good on the bike.  If your form's good and your smiling during an XC race, watch out.  Barring bad luck, you're going to have a breakthrough race.</p>

<p>I immediately called Dave on his cell to let him know the progress at our end of the course.  Dave's the kind of guy that gets stoked, and he was.  Now the waiting started for him.  He had about 15 minutes before he saw anyone else come through and I had over 30 before the leaders would come back through again.</p>

<p>The racers that do the national series are a pretty tight group.  It's just like any of the fringe thing; or band of gyspies if you will.  Everybody knows everybody if you show up a few times.  Knowing Dave and Jen got me a lot of introductions the past two weeks, and one of the guys I met was <a href="http://www.tamarackidaho.com/?id=174">Dusty Labarr (Tamarack)</a>, <a href="http://www.lunabar.com/community/lunachix.cfm?documentid=114">Georgia Gould's</a> fiance.  He was working the feed zone a few yards down from me feeding Georgia.</p>

<p>The second time through, one rider came into the final straight in pink and blue.  Heather was out in front without a team mate now.  And chasing behind her, was Georgia!  At the start finish line, Georgia was about 15 seconds back.  At the end of the feed zone, about a minute's worth of riding later, Georgia was sitting on Heather's wheel.  A few more rider's came through.  Dara had pulled in 4 riders and was up to 5th at this point.  And still sitting in 8th was Jen.  She came through the feed zone again, still smiling.  The two riders in front of her were literally, right in front of her.  Maybe 15 or 20 seconds off up the climb.  </p>

<p>I called Dave again, to update him.  I knew she had it in her to reel the girls in front of her up, now it was just a matter of having luck on her side.</p>

<p>I went down to the start/finish line and met up with Dusty.  He was reduced to nearly biting his nails.  Georgia's raced pro for three years and has consistently had good finishes all season.  Her best so far had been 4th and 2nd places in the Deer Valley <abbr title="cross country">XC</abbr> and short track the week before.   I don't think he stood still for more than 5 seconds the entire 40 minutes after she went through the feed zone the last time.  He called Dave a time or two to find out the result.  She and Heather had gone through the second feed zone still together, neither showing any obvious signs of fatigue.  When a rider finally appeared in the final stretch, it was Georgia.  Dusty went over and hugged and kissed her, let her get on to the interviews and spent the next 15 minutes with a phone glued to his ear calling everyone :D</p>

<p>Now it was a waiting game for me to find out how Jen had done.  Heather came in in second place, <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/2006/diaries/mary/">Mary McConneloug</a> a favorite for the win and the defending national champ was in third.  Then rolled in Dara.  She'd broken her streak of 6th place finishes for the year and at the biggest race of the year.  Had luck been on her side, she probably would have won.  Next up was <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/bios/user/bio.php?id=69">Sue Haywood</a>.  Then Jen came rolling in... 6th place at the national championship!  She was so excited she was shaking.  It was her best finish of the season, and the best finish of her career.</p>

<p>On the final climb of the day, she could see Shonny in front of her and she had Sue with her.  Jen was climbing better than Sue, but told Sue to stay on her wheel and the podium was hers.  Sue stuck to her wheel, and then out descended Jen for the 5th and final spot on the podium.  As the excitement of an unbelievable race started to wear off, Jen started to reget the decision to encourage Sue, but I think it was an act that shows Jen for who she is, a true competitor that wants everyone she races against to do the best that they can.</p>

<p>There were a few other "local" (to me) riders at nationals too.  <a href="http://www.bearnakedgranola.com/cannondale/riders/baum.htm">Nina Baum</a> (Bear Naked/Cannondale) had a horrible race as far as placing goes, but had a smile on her face every time I saw her.  She ran into some bad luck on the course with mechanicals I believe.  The times I saw her she was flying though.  <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/results/index.php?compid=156279">Shannon Gibson</a> (Yeti) had a solid 13th finish despite not feeling good going into the race.  She just keeps getting faster the older she gets.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that was my two hours at the women's national championship.  A fun way to spend a late Friday afternoon.  Man, you know you've got it bad when you watch a pro XC race and consider it good fun.  :)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I felt so gun-hoe about riding I almost went for a ride last night.  I decided against it, but wanted to put in an hour or so today of just slow miles.  For me, I deem recovery nose breathing.  If I can do it and keep my breath slow and steady through my nose, I'm ok.  I look at HR as too subjective and my resting heart rate dropped 10 <abbr title="beats per minute">bpm</abbr> in the last two weeks, so it would be completely off.  So, off I went this morning, feeling decent at the start.</p>

<p>45 minutes later, I rolled back into the garage toasted.  I didn't go hard.  I think my average <abbr title="heart rate">hr</abbr> had to be 130 or lower, but I was just toasted.  So this two recovery weeks is definitely a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.daramarksmarino.com/">Dara's</a> had a <a href="http://www.juniper-solutions.com/dara/?p=107">good metaphor for racing</a> as life.  If it wasn't for my stubbornness, I would have packed up my toys and gone home half way through the marathon.  Congrats need to go out to Dara too, she was second in the women's pro short track on Sunday.</p>

<p>I can't remember if I've said anything on my site about this, but I've started a <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/weekly-photo/">weekly featured photo</a> on <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/">my photo site</a>.  This <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/weekly-photo/Sunset-on-my-biking-trip.jpg.html">week's photo</a> is so cool, I wanted to share it here too.  I took it from the Dairy Queen parking lot in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=Ludlow,+CA">Ludlow, California</a> on my way back Saturday night.  What a site to close the final day of my two weeks of riding, huh?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every morning, I track my weight, body fat percentage, and resting heart rate.  I didn't take my scale with me the last two weeks, so I hadn't been keeping those numbers.</p>

<p>This morning was the first time to take them again.  I gained a pound and a half the last two weeks, but my body fat dropped by nearly 2% (or relatively by 18%) and my resting heart rate dropped from the mid 50s to the mid 40s!</p>

<p>This is the start of two weeks of rest and recovery.  This week is more so than next.  Next I'll start to do some low volume intensity workouts, but this week the only thing I'll do is some spinning on the road bike or maybe an easy mountain bike ride or two.  </p>

<p>Right now though, I'm off the bike until I get a helmet.  Mine disappeared at nationals after the marathon.  I'm not sure if I left it sitting somewhere.  I know I had it right after the race and I know I took it off when I got into some shade, but more than that I'm not sure.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just heard from Dave - he took the national championship for Expert 30+ short track today!  The same guys that attacked him yesterday tried to control the race early on.  He had to chase back in, but once he got back in the lead group he controlled the race.  There's one more semi-pro racing in New Mexico now.</p>

        <title>Quick two week recap: National marathon</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/16/quick_two_week_recap_national_marathon/"/>
        <updated>2006-07-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/16/quick_two_week_recap_national_marathon</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I finally understand why so many people update their blgos so rarely during the summer months when nationals are in full swing.  I spent the majority of the last weeks on the road and there was so much to occupy myself with that this came in somewhere toward the bottom of the list of things to do.</p>

<p>I'll try to write up a bit more about these in individual posts because if I put everything in this one I'd have to talk to a publisher about binding it for sale.  Meg wouldn't be happy.  :-)</p>

<p>The Deer Valley race in Utah was unbelievable.  An hour's worth of climbing (for me taking it easy) followed by some unbelievable downhill fun.  Guys like <a href="http://epicriding.blogspot.com/">Adam</a> have some unbelievable trails in their back yards.  I spent the whole race thinking I was in 2nd because a local guys riding for Jan's was asking around if there were any "other" (I thought anyhow) 19 - 29.  He was gone on the climb and I didn't try to stay with him.  I was out to finish and just get points, no pressure on it.  Turns out he wasn't in my age group and no one else was.  Another win for showing up.</p>

<p>Got to watch Jen and Dave Wilson put in good races on Saturday.  Dave lost his first national race (the XC on Saturday) of the season by 4 bike lengths, but laid it down on Sunday by attacking on the second lap of the short track just to see how far he could take it.  Four laps to go he decided to try to lap the entire field and made it within a 1/4 lap.  Jen had another 22nd in the XC on Saturday, finishing with a huge asthma attack.</p>

<p>After watching Dave race Sunday, I headed out to California.  Spent some eleven hours on the road.  I spent a few hours on the road Monday afternoon getting in some good intervals.  I felt great and was amazed at how hard I could push and how high my heart rate would go without loosing my breath.  A new sensation after a week in Utah.  Some pre-rides of the course had me feeling good on it.  There were only a few sections that felt sketchy to me, but they were short enough that I knew I could handle them.</p>

<p>Thursday rolled around.  We had 4 guys in my field.  Just looking at the competition, I figured <a href="http://www.ifcoltcouldfly.blogspot.com/">Colt</a> was going to be my main competition.  I held with him easily through the first climb.  We got into into the first single-track, a 22%, fall-line trail.  I stood up and my chain slipped.  Ok, run to the top and catch up.  I chased and we were back together by the time we got through the long climb.  As I started the long climb, I felt water trickling down my back.  My camelbak bladder had come undone.  Half way through my first lap, I'm without water.</p>

<p>No problem, it's cool, there's only 10 minutes til I'm back to the feed zone and I'll swap out packs and hope someone will help me out by refilling this one.  Me and Colt role through the feedzone together, and I bail.  I lost a minute or two getting that squared away, and his legs started coming on.  He was off, and my shifter housing was about to blow.  By the end of the second lap I couldn't shift anything but the front unless I was on bumpy terrain.  The bumps would knock it into a larger gear in the rear then it'd start shifting ok.  Not good.</p>

<p>Colt started pulling away and instead of chasing him down like I should have I took the gamble that since this was his first marathon he'd crack by going out too fast.  I went into the preservation mode like this was a 12+ hour race when I should have laid it all out.  Could have, should have, would have, though... right?</p>

<p>Colt and Dezmin rode good races.  I made a few tactical errors and pile on not being able to use any of my gears for any nuance on the climbs and I floundered.  Once I lost track of first, I seriously thought of pulling.  I was there for a jersey, and it didn't look like I was going to get that, but two things kept coming back.  One, I spent all of last week thinking I was in second until after the race.  Maybe this would be a repeat?</p>

<p>Two, I remembered how disappointed I felt with Tyler pulled out of the '04 Tour when it became obvious he wasn't going to win.  He later blamed it on his back, but in the interview right after he pulled out of the race he said "I came here to win, not race for second" or something similar.  That was the guy who raced through a broken collar bone in '03 just to finish.  Now he was quiting because he wasn't going to win.  I wasn't going to be that guy, so I plugged away.</p>

<p>I was right at 26 minutes off.  Finished 3rd.  Not bad, except it was third of three finishers.  Yeah yeah, I know.  There's how many hundreds of registered racers that could have raced that didn't and I beat all of them just by showing up and finishing.</p>

<p>I'll break this into another post, but I got to watch a great racer and friend get her best finish ever at a national race, 6th in the Women's Pro XC.  Jen Wilson really had the ride of her life Friday night and it was great to be a part of it.  It was two hours worth of racing, but I'll save that for another post.  Hopefully, Dave is the short track champ right now.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And here's the data from my national championship ride.  You'll notice my exertion went way down on lap 5 and 6.  All of them were actually 4% lower than they should have been.  That still wasn't enough to win, but it would have made it closer.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/accept.mb?senderPk.pkValue=6232&amp;unitSystemPkValue=2&amp;episodePk.pkValue=1061922&amp;backgroundDatasourcePk.pkValue=2&amp;view=portlet"  width="530px" height="300px" title="MotionBased Activity Viewport" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"> </iframe></p>

<p>And yes, there was over 2,000 more vertical feet of climbing at nationals than at Deer Valley.  For a non-mountain course, 11.5k (over 13k for the pros) of climbing in a day isn't too shabby.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, the nerves are starting to kick in.  I'm going to go put in a lap or two this afternoon to get the full course in so I know where I'm going.  Yesterday's attempted preview missed one section of the course.  After that I'm going to try to find out how many riders are registered.  I look for a few, but I was expecting a half dozen at Deer Valley, so I don't know who'll show up.</p>

<p>The race starts at 7 AM Pacific time.  Be sure to send fast thoughts my way in the morning.</p>

<p>Just to start some forward thinking, this race tomorrow marks a peak for the season for me.  I'm taking two weeks off (3 hours a week or less with smaller number of intensity workouts).  After the two weeks off I'll hop back into the racing mode in August at Brian Head.  Brian Head is just a training race and to tie up the national series title.  The next big race I have planned is the New Mexico State Championship in Las Cruces the end of August.  After that, racing's up for grabs for the rest of the year.  I'll probably do the Road Apple in Farmington if I have a jersey to pick up.  I'm also thinking about the Dust Devil series in AZ especially since they have a Marathon category.  I'll already be in transition for next year, so those are going to be low priority races just for base miles.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow.  Mornings north of San Francisco are a little overcast.</p>

<p>I'm in California now and have Internet access that's all mine again instead of having to poach library access.  The Utah trip was good, I got in some good mountain biking and road riding while I was there and waking up to mid-50s in the crisp mountain air was great.  I could definitely see myself spending the summers somewhere like that.</p>

<p>I recovered pretty good from the marathon and am ready for this next one on Thursday.  I'm going to try to go get in some riding on the course today, if it's open.  I'm not sure if it'll be open to riding since it's on private property.</p>

<p>I've got a ton of pictures from the women's pro XC race and got a bunch of my buddy Dave Wilson while he bent the Expert 30+ short track field over the table and had his way with them.  He nearly lapped the entire field.  He's got two more races as an expert - the National XC and Short Track and he's upgrading to semi-pro.  Back to the pictures though, I'm going to try to post 'em up today if I get a chance.</p>

        <title>Undefeated at the national level</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/07/undefeated_at_the_national_level/"/>
        <updated>2006-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/07/07/undefeated_at_the_national_level</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well... I haven't actually beat anybody, but nobody's beat me either. :D</p>

<p>I'm currently at the library for my Internet connection, so I'm keeping this one short.  Yesterday was a sufferfest.  We started out with an hour's worth of climbing, I'm guessing all told we ended up with around 3k - 4k in that first hour (or hour for me).  I kicked it up a little at the start to try and keep a decent placing in the first section of single track, then settled into a comfortable rhythm for the rest of the climb.  I was planning on turning laps around 2 hours and set my first at 2:05 so I was pleased.</p>

<p>Second lap, just died.  If it wasn't for the points and the assumption that there was at least one (I thought possibly two or three from looking around at the start) other guys in my category that I thought I might be racing in Brian Head for the series title, there wouldn't have been much motivation to go on.  I toughed it out though, and as I got about half way up the first climb on the second lap, I lost all but three gears - 22x32, 34x22, and 44x22.  Blew out another shifter housing.  Second marathon in a row that's happened, and third time this year.  Time for some <a href="http://www.nokon.de/">Nokon</a> housing.</p>

<p>When I shifted to into preservation mode I set my goal as not being lapped by the pro leader.  I'm at the bottom of a double switch back 200 yards from the finish and I hear brakes behind me.  I look back, there's Travis Brown in his solid black.  Another goal I had for this race was to finish with some energy.  Well, though my legs would have told you otherwise, I had a bit left in me.  I sprinted the final 200 yards to keep from getting lapped and finished about 15 seconds ahead of Brown.  Granted, he finished three laps in the time it took me to do two, but...</p>

<p>So, all in all a good week.  There's only one rider in the country who can beat me for the series title now.  And it would take a combination of him winning Brian Head and me not finishing it in order for that to happen.  And even then, it's really a tie, but it goes back to the last highest finish to break the tie.</p>

<p>The course was epic, but I was disappointed in the turn out.  I really thought we'd have at least a half dozen guys show up.  There wasn't but 20 or so riders in the pro field.  I guess the $70 entry fee is steep.</p>

<p>Anyhow, once I have an internet connection in my room (Sunday night/Monday), I'll write up a little bit more about the course and the race I put in.  4:45 minutes is a long time to spend on a bike, so I'm sure I can come up with more than a few hundred words.</p>

<p>And see the great big white panel on the side?  Custom made for sponsor logos and such.  It just needs some beads seperating off the bead room.  That's almost made up for though by the pink driver's seat and the magenta carpet. :D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've got everything in order now to my drive up to Park City tomorrow.  I'm heading out for a week and a half of doing the mountain biker thing.  I'll still be doing some real work remote, so it won't be all bikes all the time, but I'm still looking forward to it.</p>

<p>The plan is to leave out early tomorrow morning for Park City.  I've rented a small studio condo through Sunday.  The race is on Thursday (or Wednesday, if you believe the <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/pdfs/Deer_Valley_Elites_Athlete_Guide.pdf">athelete's guide</a>, but the girls at Team Big Bear swear it's on Thursday).  Saturday is the expert men's XC in the morning, and the pro women XC later.  I'm going to help Big Dave Wilson out with some water hand-offs on Saturday, and he's going to be scrambling around the course on Thursday to get me water.  With any luck, there'll be two feed zones that he can drive between so I don't have to carry a full 25 miles worth of water with me each lap.</p>

<p>Sunday I'm cutting out for Petaluma, CA.  The race is at the Infinion Speedway which is officially in Sonoma, but the hotels are cheaper in Petaluma and its the same distances from the speedway as Sonoma.  The plan is to stay from Sunday to Sunday out there before heading back to AZ.</p>

<p>I can't wait to get on the road, but just the same the hotel bills are going to be bigger than I'd like.  I've got to find me some sort of RV or camper or something if I'm going to be traveling a lot next year.  Hmm... Maybe a Class C with a motorcycle or something and sell my Volkswagen.  Oh well, got time to figure that all out later.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get in a ride with <a href="http://epicriding.blogspot.com/">Adam</a> over the weekend while I'm up in UT.  It's always cool to put real people with the blogs.</p>

<p>My legs are feeling good - they're right where I want them to be for this two weeks worth of racing.  Now all I've got to do is go out, put in the effort, and hope it's enough for some good results.</p>

<p>I'll have an Internet connection for most of the next two weeks, so I'll try to keep everyone updated here.</p>

Now, is Discovery going to try to keep it?  Or give it away and just use this as a shot over the bow of the other teams, or what?  So many possible tactics from here...</p>

<p>Speaking of Hincapie, am I the only one that finds <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/photos/2006/tour06/tour061/IMG_0873.jpg">this picture</a> mildly disturbing?  I mean, I know 12 years on the pro circuit will make your body adapt in ways that most people's never will (just look at <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3587/1328/1600/PICT0010.1.jpg">Ned's 50 year old legs</a>), but still... wow.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note, I hate Windows.  My computer is booted into Windows right now because I was loading my Forerunner data into MotionBased.  I got this post complete, but was looking at another site and the browser quits.  Ugh...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh yeah...  This morning felt great.  Got up late, so I didn't want to do anything too big.  Probably a good idea because some cloud cover from last night kept it warm and had the humidity up this morning.  Not pleasant riding conditions, but I felt really on.</p>

<p>Started off with a couple micro-intervals (7:30 minutes with 15 sec on/off).  Then did a 5 minute interval at 8.5-9 <abbr title="Rate of Perceived Effort">RPE</abbr>.  I had to go off of RPE because my <abbr title="Heart Rate">HR</abbr> was about 10 <abbr title="Beats Per Minute">BPM</abbr> higher than it normally is.  The effect of taking 4 days off of the bike?  Coming back into Fountain Hills, on that 6% climb, I was actually in recovery mode.  My speed was pretty low, but I was able to spin up it at about 75% - 80% of the speed I was able to do it 3 months ago.  The last half (maybe 200 - 300 yards) I kicked it up with a good sprint.  Got up to 18 mph and held it... on a 6% grade.  And all of this with my legs still feeling a little sluggish when I started out.</p>

<p>Followed this up with some steep climbing (nothing over 12%) around the northern side of Fountain Hills with <a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0002OERI0%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1151172357%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">American Idiot</a> setting my pace.  The last song which ended as I pulled into garage from the ride was Letterbomb.  The chorus to this qualifies as an anthem for everyone who harbors secret desires to be an <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report#c6217">enduro fruitcake</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's not over 'till your underground<br />
It's not over before it's too late</p></blockquote>

<p>Yup... As long as you're not dead there's still energy to keep going.</p>

        <title>Man can not live on eGel alone</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/23/man_can_not_live_on_egel_alone</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got up this morning and couldn't decide what I wanted to eat.  After an hour of trying to decide, I opted for the <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">eGel</a> and a ride route.  Downed the gel and was determined to give my legs a good beating on the hills.  </p>

<p>Started out with my Kingstree to Palamino climb.  About 4 miles, normally takes around 16 minutes (now - I started the year at over 17 minutes).  There's a ~15% grade toward the bottom of the climb that serves as a wake up.  The last time I did that, my heart rate got up to 185'ish, today when I hit it I was pushing 195!  I got into a rhythm and was feeling about like I normally do when I'm <abbr title="time trial">TT</abbr>'ing it, and hit both of the time checks (road crossings) in excellent time.  Then I got to the final 3/4 of a mile that has a few sections that kick up around 8%... and exploded.</p>

<p>Remember that gel I had?  I didn't drink enough water with it so I had a good ol' fashion gel bomb in my stomach.  I wanted to vomit.  It would have felt better.   My pace dropped big time, though I knew I was on pace for a <abbr title="personal record">PR</abbr> based on my second time check, I was done.  I pulled the pace down a bit on the steeper stuff and picked up what I could as it leveled out.  It hurt.  Then I made it to the turn around, hit the lap button.  15:44, 3 seconds off of my PR.</p>

<p>So my legs are playing it coy.  They're all "leave us alone, we're dead, we've got no umph", then they pull that out.  Nutrition and traffic kept me from a personal record.  If I had eaten something more easily digestable for breakfast and didn't have to wait nearly 10 seconds for traffic to clear at the first road crossing, I would have shattered my old PR.  Oh, and I just put a new training tire on the rear wheel that's about a quarter pound heavier than the tires I had been using.</p>

<p>Yup - I'm as ready for these upcoming races as I've been all year. </p>

<p>All of the helmet cam footage is stuff I shot during the race.  Vlad did an awesome job putting it all together to make the video.  When you see someone in the race that's wearing day glow yellow, that's me :)</p>

<p>So now to figure out how to get my name on IMDB for the work on this ;)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lasted 20 minutes with two flats.  No sooner than I had reached the Fountain Hills city limit sign did I notice that the rear wheel felt squishy.  Shit, with a new tube and all.  I was loosing air slowly, so I put a cartridge in it and limped home to put in <em>another</em> tube.  I checked the tire this time, feeling stupid for not having done that when the first swap out.  There's nothing in it.  Hmm...  Put the new tube in and pump it up.  It holds air to out I go.</p>

<p>This time, I'm 3 minutes away from the house.  My legs are feeling great because of the 16 minute warm-up I got.  <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greenday/americanidiot.html">American Idiot</a> is blaring in my ears, I'm pumping an awesome rhythm, and... </p>

<p>Ok, so now I'm headed home pissed.  I should have put some more air in it.  Not doing that meant 30 minutes on the truing stand this morning, but I was pissed.</p>

<p>This time of the season that can really take it out of you.  It borders on burnout and breakdown at the same time.  I'm pretty sure this just a product of this last week's training: the hardest week of the year and will stay that way until after nationals.  Couple that with not eating half as good as I should, and my system is all out of whack.  It's amazing how fragile - no, that's not the right word... temperamental - the human body becomes when you start pushing it towards its limits.</p>

<p>The next few weeks are going to be a less intense with a focus more on steady miles.  The way I'm feeling, I'm starting to think the <a href="http://nmcycling.org/flyers/SPwatermelonBro06.pdf">Watermelon</a> is out of the question.  It's two trips up the Sandia mountains in Albuquerque.  I know it'd be an awesome training ride, but 10 hours driving plus a hotel bill...  If it's just for training I can manage that a lot closer.  Plus, the non-race thing means I don't have to completely kill myself on the climb.  Two weeks before two big marathons?  Just seems like it could be a very bad idea.</p>

Folks in Vermont don't believe in cameras apparently.  Come on guys, this is crazy...  A some results and a handful of pictures would be nice.</p>

<p>I know what <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb/2006/jun06/NORBA_3_06/NORBA_3_062">you do</a>.  The new Epics are around 19 pounds?!  Geez, that thing's got to be a rocket.  Looking at the podium, seems to be working for #1 and #2.</p>

<p>It also came out that <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=news/2006/jun06/jun17mtbnews">Mount Snow</a> (scroll down) will host the US National Championships for the next two years.  I wonder why they're doing two in a row?  Seems like they'd mix it up a bit.  Guess this means I'll be in Vermont in July the next two years.</p>

        <title>Product Review: Wingnut Hyper 2.5</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/18/product_review_wingnut_hyper_2_5/"/>
        <updated>2006-06-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/18/product_review_wingnut_hyper_2_5</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Better late than never, right?  Here's my thoughts on the Wingnut.  I've got a few rides in with it now, so I think I'm starting to get a feel for it.</p>

<p>First, the good.  The back rides great.  I've got it dialed in according to what <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2006/05/07/1058.aspx#_ctl0__ctl0__ctl0__ctl0__ctl6__ctl0_Comments__ctl0_Comments__ctl6_PermaLink">Scott</a> had to say in a previous email.  It rides well and the wing pockets are perfect.  That's the way jersey pockets on mountain bike jerseys should be, angled forward with lots of room.  I feel I could easily pack enough food and such for a full day of riding with this pack.  All I'd have to figure out is where to refill it at.</p>

<p>The swiveling bite valve is great.  It's much easier to reposition it on the fly than a camelbak.  It's one of those "why haven't they done this before" kind of things.  And the detactable shoulder harness - perfect.  One problem I've always had with my camelbaks are the shoulder harnesses serving as repository for salt.  If it were as simple as unhooking the straps to throw them in the wash, they'd be there after every ride.</p>

<p>Second, the average.  The position of this pack really throws into focus and saddle positioning issues you might not realized you had.  Having all of the weight on the lower back focuses it on the saddle, which is causing me to re-evaluate its positioning.  I'll be tweaking that a little the next few rides to see if those adjustments help.</p>

<p>Now, the bad.  It might just be that I've used a camelbak for so long that my mouth doesn't know how to handle any other type of bite value, but I just can't get this one down.  I think it might be because it seems to be made to work more with your front teeth and I always bit with the side of my mouth more.  The "lock" on it kept partially engaging too.  I could times I went to get a drink and it was at a trickle.  A good tug to open it back up did the trick though.</p>

<p>Hose length is also an issue for me.  I'm 6' and have a pretty long torso (proper <abbr title="Top Tube">TT</abbr> length is around 24.75") so I may be the exception, but I don't like having to tuck my chin in to reach the bite value.  With the bladder positioned for the best routing of the hose that I could come up with (the connector opposite the side the hose is routed out of), I needed another 6" - 10".  I tried repositioning the bladder so the hose was on the same side that it went out of the pack.  That actually got me the length I needed, but the sharp angle caused the hose to bind.  Every time I would go to take a drink, I'd have to fiddle with the hose where it went into the pack to give it the flex it needed.</p>

<p>After the three rides I've taken with it, there's a few things I would change:</p>

<ul><li>Make the hose the same diameter as a camelbak so you can swap out the bite valve if you want.</li>
<li>Offer extended hose lengths for tall guys.  If I'm having issues with the length, I can't imagine what guys in the 6'3"+ range would do.</li>
<li>Put the hose connection to the bladder on one of the corners instead of on the side at the corner.  One of the off-brand packs already does this.  With the square bladder design, this seems perfectly suited.</li>
<li>Or, Put one of the swivel elbows on the bladder connector so you can redirect the hose without crimping</li></ul>

<p>I really, really want to like this pack.  It's super lightweight and seems very well built.  The design rides really well and I didn't have any back fatigue on the few 1.5 - 2 hour rides I took it on.  But... until I can get the hose issues resolved, I just can't see using it at a race.  It takes too much effort to take a drink.  Fiddling with the hose, working the bite valve, they all just add up to make it more of a hassle than it's worth.</p>

<p>I'll be giving Scott a buzz this week to see if he has any suggestions.  I'll report back what comes out of it.  I know there's a few of you who're running these packs, so if you've hit any similiar issues, feel free to offer suggestions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Geez...  I took yesterday, well sort of.  I was going to go for a ride, but wasn't really into the idea.  15 minutes in my rear wheel had that springy feeling of a slow leak.  Yup, lost about 70 psi.  I know when to read the signs.  Popped a cartridge worth of air into it and rode home.  So it was essentially a day off.</p>

<p>This morning, I overslept by about an hour.  Should have been sign enough for me that today needed to be an off day, but I fixed breakfast and headed out.  I was feeling decent and was planning on getting 3 - 4 hours in on the mountain bike.  45 minutes into it I would have hopped in a car and driven home had that been an option.  By the time I got off of the trail and I had spent an hour and a half on the bike, and my legs feel like they should fall off.</p>

<p>At least it's happening now, and not in a few weeks.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, this morning was great.  I got up about 5 - with no alarm clock other than the first light of morning and got ready for a ride.  As I left the garage, the sun rise was an unbelievable shade of orange with the clouds over Four Peaks.  There's not many better ways to start the morning.</p>

<p>I decided I needed some time on the mountain bike today and headed over to <a href="http://www.maricopa.gov/parks/mcdowell/">MMP</a> to do some micro-intervals.  The idea is that the quick acceleration and short recovery is good for building endurance.  I was up for trying something new, and they were... interesting.  I did 2 sets of 30 intervals of 15 seconds on, 15 seconds off - or 15 minutes total - with 5~ minute rests in between.  </p>

<p>The first two minutes were torture.  My body wasn't used to that rapid acceleration and deceleration.  Once you push through the first few minutes though, you start to get into a rhythm that's kind of cool.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I decided to try these today was to work on acceleration in places I normally back off when I'm on dirt.  I'm bad about pushing into a comfortable rhythm, then letting the flow of the trail take over instead of pushing.  Setting yourself to go every fifteen seconds means you're pushing with no regard for what the trail is throwing at you; climb, descent, turn, whatever.  By the end of second set, I had really gotten into a good rhythm and was feeling much more comfortable accelerating on just about anything.</p>

<p>I followed up my last 5 minute rest with an "interval" back out to the parking lot from the South Ridge on the Long Loop.  Ended up having a really good ride back and felt strong.  Those short bursts followed by a long sustained effort felt really good.  When I got through with my ride my legs were at that perfect "tired" stage where you know you've worked them just hard enough.</p>

        <title>First impressions of my new Wingnut</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To pull a phrase from <a href="http://epicriding.blogspot.com/">Adam</a>, the brown santa came yesterday.  I wasn't home, so he visited the office at my apartment complex which was closed by the time I got home last night so, to make a longer sentence longer, I was unable to ride with my new <a href="https://www.wingnutgear.com/product_details.cfm?id=117">Wingnut Hyper 2.5</a> this morning, but am going to take it out for its madien voyage manana.</p>

<p>First thought, wow... this thing's huge.  It makes my Mule seem scrawny.  This is definitely going to work as a replacement for my longer rides, something I was worried about.  Now I'm wondering if I should have gone with the Assault for racing though.  The only thing that worried me with it was the 1.5 liters.  I almost went dry with 70 oz. in Gallup and went dry with 100 oz. in Santa Fe.  Fifty something just doesn't seem like enough for me.  Now if they made an Assault with larger bladder, that might work.</p>

<p>With any luck, this pack will be my secret (or not so) weapon at the upcoming marathons.  On longer rides the normal camelbaks start busting my lower back.  These are supposed to be better, so we'll see.  </p>

        <title>Quick Movie Review: An Inconvenient Truth</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/11/quick_movie_review_an_inconvenient_truth/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/11/quick_movie_review_an_inconvenient_truth</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wait, what's this?  A post not related to cycling?  Yup :>></p>

<p>Friday night I went to see Al Gore's <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">An Inconvenient Truth</a> with <a href="http://leftof.net/">Meg</a>.  It was good, but a bit on the long side.  Actually, the movie could have been drilled down to a 30 minute short, but that wouldn't have fit the bill for a feature piece.</p>

<p>The bad: there were segments where he would go off on a tangent and I caught myself more than once go "and this has to do with global warming how?"  He eventually brought everything together, but there were two pieces in particular that seemed to drift for a minute or two before he brought them full circle.  There were some political jokes and jibs that will really turn off the people who could get the most out of this movie.  They didn't really need to be there, but will work well as base motivators for '08.</p>

<p>The good: there was a lot of little pieces of information here and there that the average joe probably doesn't know.  One of my favorites: of the 928 peer reviewed scientific papers on global warming in 2004, not one disputed it while 53% of pop-culture (NY Times, WashPost, etc.) news sources considered it a "theory" or unproven.  </p>

<p>The mediocre: if you've followed this topic, you probably already know 95% of what's covered in the movie.  There's nothing shocking in it.  If you get all of your scientific news from the mainstream, then some of this will be news to you.</p>

<p>All-in-all, I've got to recommend this movie.  It's got a message that needs to get out.  The problem with it is that the people who could use to see it, the ones that consider global warming "an interesting theory", probably aren't going to go see it.  And if they do, they'll be put off but a handful of politically slanted comments.  Personally, I think Gore would have left the parisanship aside if he was really doing this to further his goals on this "moral issue" alone.  The fact that he didn't suggests strongly to me that he's trying to keep his name in front of people for an '08 or '12 run for the big house again.</p>

        <title>Mountain bike news coverage?</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/11/mountain_bike_news_coverage</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why doesn't <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/">Cycling News</a> have a link to <a href="http://www.skisugar.com/showdown/results.phtml?race=11">this site</a>?  You'd think they would copy and paste the results, but no... you have to go searching for them on your own.  They don't have the today's (Sunday's) results up yet, but they have to the I was curious about.</p>

<p>Congrats to David Wilson on his second <abbr title="Short Track">STXC</abbr> <a href="http://www.skisugar.com/showdown/results.phtml?race=6">win</a> of the year.  He's kicking ass defending the 30+ expert series title.  Stars and stripes are in his future...  <a href="http://www.skisugar.com/showdown/results.phtml?race=11">El Paso</a> was well represented in the women's pro with Shannon Gibson and Jen Wilson (wife of above) placing 18th and 22nd in the <abbr title="Cross Country">XC</abbr> race.  Shannon's been doing awesome considering broke several bones back in January.  </p>

<p>Other locals with a good weekend: <a href="http://www.juniper-solutions.com/dara/?p=94">Dara</a> took 8th despite some technical problems including her rear wheel coming off at one point on her first lap.  I'm not sure how someone could mentally recover from that one.  I guess it's part of the mental edge that makes her a pro.  Nina Baum from Albuquerque took 15th.  She erased the two minute start difference on me last week in about 15 minutes (at least I had quit "racing" at that point - or that's what I keep telling myself).  Another name I recognized was Jen Tilley from Lawrence, KS (a used to be local to me).  I paced myself off of her and another female pro at <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/travis-photos/travis_at_psycowpath_1.jpg.html">Psycowpath opener</a> last year.</p>

<p>I wonder how hard it would have been for whoever was covering the Sugar Mtn. race for Cycling News to have someone snap a quick shot of the results sheet and post it to their website?  Pay one of the locals $5 a race to shoot photos when the results are posted if it's beneath you...  There were over 110 pro racers yesterday, but according to <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb/2006/jun06/NORBA_2_06/NORBA_2_062#res">their results</a> only 10 of them mattered.  Forget the fact that there's nothing on any of the races below pro.</p>

<p>And people wonder why sponsorships are drying up?  If you're not on the point at the pointy end of the field you're not getting any coverage.</p>

        <title>Looking toward the coming year</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/11/looking_toward_the_coming_year/"/>
        <updated>2006-06-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/11/looking_toward_the_coming_year</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, it's barely June and I'm already thinking about 2007.  Wow.  I guess I'm trying to occupy my thoughts with something else besides <a href="http://www.kucharik.com/images/Jerseys/2001/01Stars&amp;Stripes%20Jersey.JPG">stars and stripes</a>.  So far this season is coming along well.  I'm getting to the point that it's almost on auto-pilot through the end of the summer.  All I have to do is keep at it.</p>

<p>So to next year.  I've got a few things I want to do, I just haven't figured out if I'll be able to do all of them.  Some might be contradictory.  In the vain of <a href="http://epicriding.blogspot.com/2006/06/deer-valley-xc.html">perhaps even unrealistic</a>, here they are.</p>

<ul><li>Win the 25 - 29 Expert XC <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/">national series</a> title</li>
<li>Finish top ten at every national I compete at</li>
<li>Podium (top 5) at the national championship in XC</li>
<li>Have enough strong finishes at the national level to upgrade to semi-pro</li>
<li>Win the AZ state series title - a toughy because I'll be racing in a 19 - 39 age group</li>
<li>Successfully defend (assuming the season continues as planned) the NM series title</li>
<li>Finish a 24 hour solo race (I'm thinking Old Pueblo)</li></ul>

<p>The major one of these that's in question is Old Pueblo.  Seems like the training for it would be good base work leading up to the rest of the season, but it also seems like I'd kill the first two months of the year working solely on endurance instead of intensity.  I guess the major factor is how I finish up this season.  If I finish it up and think I have a real shot at all of my other goals for next year and that's the only one that doesn't fit... well, I guess it will end up being one of the things to move into the '08 column.</p>

<p>I can't decide if I want to persue number 4 on that list - upgrade to semi-pro.  The reasoning is simple, but requires a bit of background.</p>

<p>When I started racing a few years back, I started by jumping straight into sport and finished my first race in 14th out of 15 or 16.  I was riding with mid-packer sports at the time and felt I would have too much pressure if I started at beginner because I would have expected to win everything.  I'm super competitive, and decided I would race a category ahead of myself to keep the pressure off and make it more fun.  That worked the first half of the season, but by the end of the season I was one of those sport racers that all the other ones complain about being a sandbagger.  I wasn't winning races, but I was always in the chase.  Most of them didn't know that was my first year racing.</p>

<p>The fall after that season I upgraded to expert to keep my racing "in over my head" and then all but quit racing.  Two years later - this year - I decided to keep my expert card and see what I could pull off instead of taking the safe option and downgrading back to sport.  I knew if I downgraded I would put a lot of pressure on myself to win every race I showed up at - afterall I had raced at least a few times as an expert.</p>

<p>If I reach my goals for next year - especially the national ones - and stay at expert, I'll go into '08 expecting to dominate.  I know the pressure I'll put on myself.  But if I upgrade, the only reason I can see to do that is as a stepping stone to a pro card.  I'm not a person of half messures; if I get my pro card, I think I'd owe it to myself to really dedicate myself to a season so I can say I did it... even if it was just for one unsuccessful year.</p>

<p>But those decisions are a few years off... or at least a year and a half before I have to decide if I want to go down that path.  Is it ambitious?  Yeah, maybe too much so.  But I've never been accused of setting my goals too low.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pain, cursing, sweat, more pain, more sweat, more cursing = Top of the world.</p>

<p>Ouch that mountain hurts.  <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/2006/06/crest-climb.html">Matt thought better</a> of heading up to Flag this weekend because of the "festivities".  I, on the other hand don't think to see what's happening in a town before I go there.  Instead, I show up in downtown en route to the mountain bike parking lot.  "Oh, there's a festival up here this weekend...  Wow, that's a big flag.  And it's a rainb - <em>oh</em>."  At least the people watching post ride was interesting.</p>

<p>'ve determined I don't like Flagstaff after today and it's not because it's <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/06/05/la_tierra_torture_spanish_for_sand_tortu">sandy</a>.   It's because of what it does to me.  It makes me entertain thoughts of quiting my job, moving up there and flipping burgers in the evenings so I ran ride all day long.   Not that there's anything wrong with flipping burgers, but it just doesn't pay as well as medical software programming.</p>

<p>My route today was pretty familiar.  I wanted to hit some of the same trails I did on the big bike with a cross country bike and see how they were.  I climbed Mt. Elden with five liters of water...  Again, ouch.  Made it to the top in 1:01 and change.  I was pleased, but thought I was going to be a lot closer to 45 minutes.  I got to what I thought was about the 75% point at 30 minutes, turns out it was the half way point.  Anyhow, climbed well... the climb just goes on forever.  I did everything but the last 200 yards after you pass the gate in my middle ring.  That was with a 32 in the back on a 29'er, or like riding up a 8% climb for 7 miles in your middle ring at the 28 tooth on little bike.</p>

<p>A few minutes later and a Clifbar later, I was on my way down... for the next half hour!  Man, that's the beauty of climbing for that much time... there's one sweet downhill waiting for you.  I biffed it right before the Sunset/Heart intersection.  Not sure what happened, my front wheel got loose, then sideways.  I thought I saved it, but it didn't roll when it needed to and I did a belly flop onto the trail.  This is right after a section they call the Catwalk/Organ Donor.  At least I didn't get to see if the trail was aptly named.</p>

<p>From there it was down through the Hobit Forest, a fun section of rocks and switchbacks.  I wimped out on one of the drops because of the taste of dust in my mouth from the fall.  That section seemed a lot longer on my big bike last time.  Before I knew it was on Little Bear which just goes on forever.  I was in my big ring nearly the entire time down, including all those short ups.  I was amazed at how big of a gear I was pushing all day.</p>

<p>Back up Little Elden to the Shultz Pass trail head.  From there, I headed over to Weatherby and climbed up it for about 10 minutes before I decided I'd had enough climbing for the day so I headed back to the trail head to hit Brookbank over to Rocky Ridge and to the car.  No one told me that Brookbank is a climb?  30 minutes or so later I popped out at the top of it and hit this unbelievable downhill.  Roots, rocks, switchbacks... it was a riot.</p>

<p>From there I hopped out on the Mt. Elden service road down to Rocky Ridge and out.  Except as I'm within a half mile from the car I'm spinning the big ring half way through the cassette when I here thud - crack... and boom, I'm on the ground.  I had caught my pedal on a rock and really thought I shear part of my Eggbeater off.  It was ok, but I landed on my right knee - the same one that broke my fall at Whiskey and the same one who's scab just came off within the last few week.  The impact busted the newly formed scar tissue straight off.  Scar tissue is always stronger than the "real" skin it replaces, so I'm thinking when it grows back this time it will be some sort of <a href="http://catalog.troyleedesigns.com/catalog/images/06_combat_guards_red.jpg">TLD Combat Guard</a>. :D</p>

<p>Two over the bars in one day, not good.  Nothing got broke and I just have some scrapes to prove I rode this weekend, so all in all, it wasn't a half bad Saturday.  Now I've got to go check the <a href="http://www.azdailysun.com/">Daily Sun</a> for available burger flipping positions. :))</p>

        <title>Guess what's missing from the smoothie?</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/08/guess_what_s_missing_from_the_smoothie</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've fixed a few smoothies the last week or two and I kept trying to figure out what it was that they were "missing".  I think I put my finger on it: high fructose syrup.  There's no straight sugar in them.  That's a good thing actually, and it's not that they're turning out bad, they just taste a little different that I excepted because they aren't a mass marketed smoothie.</p>

<p>So far I've done banana-strawberry and peach - both were pretty good.  Next up is orange-banana then maybe some orange-grapefruit.  Any recommendations are welcome.</p>

<p>To pay homage to my geeky side, I just upgrade my laptop's <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> distro to 6.10.  Wow, has Ubuntu got that process down.  Started the upgrade manager, clicked upgrade distro, and a half hour and a few prompts later I was done.  When I finished up work this evening, I started the process on my desktop, hopefully it'll be go as smoothly.</p>

<p>Today is a rest day, no riding.  Did some intervals yesterday, though not as many as I had planned.  Tuesday's ride really put it to me.  Tomorrow I'll probably go for a spin for an hour or so and to keep my legs loosened up for the weekend.  Might be playing up in Flag with who <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/">Dave</a> describes as "<a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2006/05/29/1209.aspx">Albuquerque Strongman</a>", <a href="http://www.mcturge.blogspot.com/">Matt</a>.  He'll probably kick me up one side of the mountain and down the other, but it's all good.  So long as there's no sand. ;)  Follow that up with the possibility of a moonlight ride at <abbr title="McDowell Mountain Park">MMP</abbr> and an "expiratory" (some of us <em>should</em> make it through alive) ride in Payson on Sunday, and it's shaping up like it might be a pretty good weekend.</p>

<p>In other random news, I'm at 183,000 (plus Wednesday's ride) vertical feet of climbing.  That's 6 Everests and I'm just into June.  Sweet.  I'll have no problem knocking out the quarter million mark, but now the question becomes can I hit the half million.  I won't be able to do the full million this year like I'd hoped, but there's next year.  I've put in 1,673 miles.  Add in Wednesday's ride and I'm closing in on 1,700.  Not too shaby when compared against less the less than 1,500 I put in for the whole of last year.</p>

<p>I'm done rambling...  go back to being productive in life. :D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, what a difference 48 hours can make.  Sunday, felt horrible on the bike.  Today, I felt like superman.  I left at 6 AM planning to do some hill intervals, but felt so awesome I decided to get in some distance tempo instead - haven't done many of those recently.</p>

<p>I did my around the mountain loop (47 miles, 3200' of climbing) which includes 9 mile hill: a nine mile 2% - 3% grind that's more mental than physical.  It's straight as an arrow for almost the entire 9 miles.  The telephone polls literally go to the horizon at the start.  Anyhow, my previous best was 2:47.  I had my GPS off for about 10 minutes after I stopped to fill the water bottles, plus the break to fill them so I'm not sure what my exact time was, but I started my ride at 6:01 and rolled back in at 8:29.  If you figure 10 minutes total that wasn't recorded, we're talking nearly 30 minutes off of my previous best a few months back!</p>

<p>I did everything in my big ring too.  Including a 6% grind up Shea back into Fountain Hills, and an 11% (only a hundred yards or so) on Palisades.</p>

<p>After this past weekend's ass stomping that the course gave me, I needed this morning's ride.</p>

        <title>La Tierra Torture: Spanish for sand torture</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/05/la_tierra_torture_spanish_for_sand_tortu/"/>
        <updated>2006-06-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/05/la_tierra_torture_spanish_for_sand_tortu</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I believe this weekend qualifies as the worst race I've had all year.  Hands down, a torture fest with no bright side that ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>First off, before I go much further I want to say that I really appreciate the effort that goes into getting these races off.  If the promoters weren't willing to step up and put them on, racers like me wouldn't have a place to go every few weeks to do this to our selves.  So thanks to all of you who were involved in getting La Tierra off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sandy, loose, dry, tight, and hot.  Those are the words I would use to describe this race.  The weekend didn't start good for me at all.  Saturday I went to pre-ride the course and set a pretty good pace the first 10 minutes or so, then we hit the first sand trap.  There's something about it for me, but when I come into a section with my heart rate up there and have to get off of my bike, it skyrockets.  So, my heart is pounding somewhere up around the top of my head, and we hit a loose, tight climb.  Absolutely no recovery, and I've cracked for the day.</p>

<p>Sunday I got up, went through my normal routine to get ready for the race and headed out to the course to warm up.  I do the top half of the course pushing part of the way, cruising part of the way and put in a time that has me figuring I can turn somewhere between 45 and 50 minute laps.  Four laps at 50 minutes?  Man, it's going to be a long day.</p>

<p>I ask around trying to find out if they're going to separate out the pros.  I know I've got at least one semi-pro in my field, so I'm trying to figure out if I'm racing for 2nd or 1st.  Then I find out they're just going to send all of the pro/expert men out at the same time and we'll get the break out after the race.  Ok, no biggie, except this means I get to follow a ton of racers up this dusty mile of a jeep road inhaling copious amounts of dry Santa Fe earth.  That, coupled with just a general feeling of being out of it, and I'm done by the time I hit the sand pit from hell.  At this point, I figure since there's only one other guy in the expert category in my age group - two if they include the semi-pro - I'll just go for a long hard training ride and hopefully at least make my entry fee back.</p>

<p>Not even half way through the first lap, the first <abbr title="Single Speed">SS</abbr> riders make it up to me.  Great, they started two minutes behind me and they're already up here kicking it into gear.  Ok, so I really <em>am</em> having a bad day.  Before I make it through the first lap, I think all but one or two of the SS racers past me.</p>

<p>So I suffer my way around the course.  About 6 miles into a 7.5 mile loop on my third lap, the eventual winner of the race laps me.  He finishes all four laps of the race a couple of minutes faster than I did 3 laps.  Ouch.  I come through the start/finish asking if I had to finish the race or if I could take my time a lap down.  I've done other <abbr title="National Off-Road Bike Association">NORBA</abbr> races where they do that, but this wasn't one of them.  Slightly dejected, I head back up the jeep road one last time to the water station to get a cup or two of cold water, dump some on my back, and am off.  Mistake.</p>

<p>When I make it to the furthest point down the hill from the only water station on the course, I go to take a drink and nothing.  Great.  It's been hot, I've been sucking down water like there's no tomorrow, and now at best I'm 15 minutes from the feed zone so I can get some more water.  Isn't this shaping up to be a great day?</p>

<p>This was largely mental.  Running out of water is one of those things that really throws me.  I drink a small sip of water every few minutes to keep my mouth from drying out.  Not having that rhythm messes with my head.  Just a few minutes after I realize I'm out of water, I make it to the first of three course marshals on the upper loop.  Then I realize I'm saved.  Each of this will hopefully have a little bit of water so I'll just limp around the course picking up a little bit at each of them and then I'll be home free.  Well, except all of the other course marshals had packed it in by the time I made it to them.</p>

<p>I finally get back to the water station, get some water in my camelbak and head out to finish the last leg of the course.  Now I'm just pissed, but I don't have the juice to push it.  The heat, the altitude, the just something took it's toll on me and I'm done.  I finished.  I wanted to curl up in a ball and go to sleep.  Or better yet, a hot tub or an ice bath.  Something, anything but there.  On my third lap I thought I saw a little girl running behind a bush out of the corner of my eye.  On my last lap after I ran out of water, I kept hearing phantom riders coming up behind me because I was hoping I could get some water off of them.  Ugh...</p>

<p>3:45 minutes for right at 30 miles.  Some week's you got it, some week's you don't.  This wasn't too much different that Gallup a few weeks ago.  Only 500 feet higher and a couple of degrees warmer, but...  This race definitely pushed the axiom "a bad day biking (fishing, hunting, driving, whatever your poison) is better than a good day at work."</p>

<p>Warning, this is a bit of a rant.  I know I sucked at this race, but the only reason I finished is that I was pretty sure there were at most only two other racers in my category so I should get something out of it if I finished.  This race wasn't worth the toll it took on my body, even for a little bit of cash.  I lost around 7 pounds, nearly 4% of my body weight, in less than 4 hours.  I should have pulled, but I didn't.  Then they start the awards.  The beginners are getting all sorts of cool stuff that's been donated by <a href="http://www.bti-usa.com/">BTI</a>.  Things like Juicy brakes (around $150 - $200 a pop!), so I'm thinking the payout for the experts should be decent.</p>

<p>Then they announce the expert field.  The first field that they're paying out: Pro/Junior/Senior Experts.  I'm in the senior experts.  So, we have one pro in the field - the guy who lapped me - the semi-pro that I knew should beat me anyway, plus the juniors, guys who are normally pulling top 10s in the overall and will probably end up going pro if they stick with it.  Nice...</p>

<p>At that point, why even have an Expert category?  We could just have everybody that's not a beginner or sport race as pro.  It's not like there's much of a step up or anything.  Now I know how the women experts must feel since they get stuck in the pro field in everything but national level races.</p>

<p>I know it's up to the promoter to handle these types of things the way they want, but I still think that was pretty lousy.  Cut the payout back if you don't have the riders in the field is one thing, but show us something for the suffering.  It's even more of a hit when you're giving away $1500 worth of swag to the beginner and sport fields.  If I would have had a dozen guys in my field, I would have pulled after the 2nd or 3rd lap.  The only thing that kept me on the course was the thought I might pick up something to help cover some of the $150 I spent doing the race.</p>

<p>Ok - end of rant.  Like I said at the start, I really appreciate the guys who step up to put these races on.  They're the ones to make the racing world go 'round.</p>

<p>On another topic directed to the women racers.  It's cruel for you to look the way you do, be married or otherwise romantically entangled, then show up after the race sans-partner with a thong on.  If you're going to wear one, great, but at least make sure it's not obvious that you are.  That, or make sure you're talking about how you're getting a divorce or breaking up and looking for an expert racer (preferably from AZ) to fill your time off the bike with. :)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, it's amazing what a couple thousand calories can do for you.  Ate a monster lunch today and downed over 3 liters of water so far today.  I'm feeling so much better than  I did yesterday, or even this morning.  I've resigned myself to the crappy finish yesterday - just one of those days.  Not the first time, and won't be the last.</p>

<p>Now I'm focused back on what I need to do racing wise - prep for the next race.  Watermelon the end of the month followed with one off week from racing, then the 3rd marathon in the national series and the national championships on back to back weeks.  It's going to be great.  Two national races, back to back, being on the road.  Man, I can't hardly think of anything better.</p>

<p>Something else that helped was <a href="http://www.offroadtoathens.com/">Off Road to Athens</a> which came today.  Man, that was brutal.  Watching those guys and gals pushing those gears in the races, knowing the pain they had to be in...  Made be cringe.  XC doesn't get much press, so having an hour and forty-five minutes devoted to it was great.  I wondered if they were going to catch on Filip Meirhaeghe's comment in the Benz.  Nice to see they gave him his due in the final credits - when I saw the bumper stick at the end, I knew they busted him.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the movie got me pysched about riding in the morning.  Supposed to be another 100+ degree day, so I'll be starting nice and early.</p>

        <title>Weekend race: La Tierra Torture in Santa Fe</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/02/weekend_race_la_tierra_torture_in_santa_/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/06/02/weekend_race_la_tierra_torture_in_santa_</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow I'm off to Santa Fe for <a href="http://www.sixhecklers.com/torture.html">La Tierra Torture</a>.  It's going to be a long haul over there and pack.  I'm figuring 7 hours each way.  Why do I do this again?  Oh yeah, because short of an S&amp;M club there's no where else I can pay money to publically inflict pain on myself along with a hundred of my closest friends. :D</p>

This is the first race in the <abbr title="New Mexico Off-Road Series".NMORS</abbr><p> that I'll be going in blind.  I've never ridden up there, but from the looks of the map looks like it should be a good course.  It appears that there's a mile or two of jeep roads, which the 29'er will love.</p>

<p>I was hoping to have my new <a href="https://www.wingnutgear.com/product_details.cfm?id=117">Wingnut Hyper 2.5</a> in for the race so I could try it in a race before the two national events come up in July.  Unless it comes today, that's not going to happen.  I should have it by the Watermelon Classic, but a week and a half later I'll be in Utah so there won't be much dial-in time at races.  Hmm...  I know a couple of you that read this have Wingnuts - does it normally take over a week to get them?</p>

This week's been kind of slow.  My legs/body haven't fully recovered from last weekend's debauchery plus helping some friends move on Tuesday from their second story appartment.  I remember why I made such a big deal about having a ground level one now.  I've been taking it easy on the bike this week with only one semi-hard day of climbing.  Hopefully, that'll have me well rested for Santa Fe.  Now if I could only figure out how to not have to sit in a car for 7 hours tomorrow I'd be golden.</abbr>

        <title>A 24 hour solo for fun?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/30/a_24_hour_solo_for_fun/"/>
        <updated>2006-05-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/30/a_24_hour_solo_for_fun</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I read <a href="http://teamdicky.blog.com/776930/">Dicky's How to have fun and race solo at the same time</a> about racing a 24 hour solo for the hell of it.  Riding around this morning on my recovery ride, it got me thinking.  I was going to skip the upcoming <a href="http://www.tucsonracing.com/PSMinf06.htm">Payson Stampede</a> because I would haven't enough time to recover from a full on 12 hour event going into nationals.  This morning it dawned on me, why not do it solo for the hell of it?</p>

<p>I wouldn't be out there to kill myself.  I'd set limits on how many laps I could ride, etc.  I want to do the <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/twofour/24.htm">24 Hours in the Old Pueblo</a> next year and actually try to put up a respectible finish, but this would give me a chance to do a 24 hour race solo so I have a better feel for what I'm up against.  Hmm...</p>

<p>Best part of Dicky's article</p>
<blockquote><p>It took a few laps of quiet introspection to come to a semi-profound realization. I don't have sponsors, my parents already love me, and I don't care what others think of me, so why give a rat's ass what gets posted. I knew my goals and that's all that really mattered in the end.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only draw back is paying $135 (or $150 if I wait two more days) to go ride.  I can do that for free, but then I can't say I've done a 24 hour race then either.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, since I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/05/28/the_miracle_of_ihop#c7292">insulted</a> the <a href="http://leftof.net/2006/05/28/happy-birthday-baby-2/">birthday girl</a>, here's the lead up to my IHOP epic.</p>

<p>Saturday night was my friend <a href="http://www.leftof.net/">Megan</a>'s birthday party - the quarter century mark.  I went having no intention sticking around very late, but at 2 AM, 2/3 of a bottle of cheap Pinot and innumerable glasses of sangria later, I decided to crash on her floor since spinning worlds and driving don't mix.  I got the floor, because the couch was taken by Megan's best friend Sarah and she didn't want to share it - funny how an engagement ring will do that to <em>some</em> girls. ;)</p>

<p>A few hours later I woke up, refreshed by what essentially was a nap and headed out to IHOP with everybody for some much needed food.  It wasn't quite 6 AM when we got the pancakes (inside joke).  Surprisingly, though my head was spinning Saturday night when I went to sleep, I woke up without a hang over.  God bless a fast metabolism.</p>

<p>For the conclusion of the story, <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/05/28/the_miracle_of_ihop">read this post</a>.</p>

<p>So everybody, wish Megan a happy birthday (it'll help keep me out off of "the list").</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... have never made spinach pesto before tonight?  Granted, there were a couple of years where I lacked the intellitual prowess to do this and it could probably be argued that some were more recent than others, but man that stuff was good.  I owe <a href="http://soiledchamois.blogspot.com/">Jason</a> a beer (or <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">eFuel</a>) for suggesting that stuff.  Wow!</p>

<p>I googled for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=spinach%20pesto">spinach pesto</a> to see what kind of proportions I should mix everything up in, read the recipe, then promptly disregarded it.  I went with the roll my own attitude that I cook burritos with and just kept mixing things together until it tasted right.</p>

<p>I started off with a little bit of <a href="http://www.bertolli.com/">Bertolli's</a> <a href="http://www.bertolli.us/oliveoil/index.cfm?t=Olive%20Oil%20Varieties">extra light</a> olive oil in the food processor with some spinach - mixed in maybe a cup or cup and a half total (if it wasn't packed) - then added some garlic powder (no fresh garlic at the kitchen, need to fix that), some freshly crushed sea salt, and topped it off with freshly ground parmesan cheese.  Mixed it with some organic whole wheat pasta, and wow!</p>

<p>I think I just found another staple of la cucina di Travis.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are going to be a blur.  The good kind, but I have a feeling I'm going to hit the third week of July and wonder where the time went.</p>

<p>It will culminate with Nationals in Sonoma; which I'll be registering for this week.  Other than that there's the marathon in Deer Valley the first week of July, and two <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org">NMORS</a> races in June.  Couple that in with a lot of training between now and then and my usual <a href="http://www.uversainc.com/">vocation</a>, and riding is what I'm going to being focusing on.  </p>

<p>Compared to April and May, June is going to be a very light race month.  That's actually good because it's going to let me do more rides like I did this morning where it's just time in the saddle.  I didn't necessarily plan it this way back in March when I decided to give the NORBA marathons a go, but it worked out this way just the same.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So today was planned as just some long steady miles.  I figured I would go up to Flagstaff and hang up with some of the other guys who are up there for the Flagstaff Fat Tire Festival, do the Peaks Loop - a 50~ mile route that's rated with a difficulty of "Biblical" according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0966476948%3Fv%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Cosmic Ray</a>.  Getting home at 7:30 AM, I decided packing up and driving 2 hours to ride 6+ hours didn't sound like a good idea.  So, on 3 - 4 hours of a sleep and an order of Chocolate Chip Pancakes from IHOP, I headed out on my bike from the house.  </p>

<p>1000 calories of <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/products/eGel/?rid=323371">eGel</a> and <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/eat/shot_blok.cfm?location=shot">Clif Bloks</a>, nearly 6 liters of water, and nearly 5 hours later I rolled back home with some 50 odd miles on my Forerunner.</p>

<p>For those who know the trails (<a href="http://www.fountainhillsguide.com/mcdowell_map_pc.tif">map here</a> if you want to follow along but don't know the trails), I cut across the state land and hopped on the Long Loop at the South Ridge sign, rode the that back out.  Rode the road up to Pemberton (B on the map) and rode it counter-clockwise all the way around to the lower Tonto Trail (the east side of M), back up to Pemberton, back over to Bluff (L), took that down to the second Granite intersection (G), rode counter clockwise back up to Bluff, Bluff back down to Granite and took a right to head back to Pemberton - back to the Trailhead Group Area for some shade, some non-eGel food, and to refill on water.  From there, it was back down to the Competative Loop (the trails on the southeast part of the map) and did the Sport all the way back to the Tech, all the way back to the Long Loop - the Marathon course.  I cut it short at the South Ridge sign and headed back home.</p>

<p>I'm toast...  I drank plenty of water, but I'm dehydrated - the residual of last night's festivities I guess.  At least I'd already planned to make today an easy day.  I can't imagine if I would have been trying to hammer that ride out today.</p>

<p>Oh, and I need to order some more <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/products/eGel/?rid=323371">eGel</a>, so everybody go sign-up and order a case (make sure the referral id is 323371).  I need some more credits so I don't have to pay :>></p>

        <title>The mental part of the race</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/28/the_mental_part_of_the_race</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After this morning's training ride for Old Pueblo (5 hours of riding on less than 4 hours of sleep - great training, or just being irresponsible, take your pick), my normal pithy writing style might be slightly impeared.  That being that case, I'll apologize up front in case this post gets out of hand.</p>

<p>Last week I mentioned the mental aspect to my win at <a href="">Gallup</a>.  Granted, the field was small - only 3 racers, but I was on the other end of the field in <a href="">Cloudcroft</a> when I was 3rd out of 3 - but it was my first XC win and I think it came down to mental preparedness for the race.  Here's why...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I knew up front they were seperating the Pros and the Experts.  One of the caveats of racing in smaller races where there's not a lot of pros is that they tend to put everybody together.  Doing that leaves the Experts to battle for 2nd, or 3rd, or sometimes even 4th as was the case in the 30 -39 in Cloudcroft.  I go into a lot of the races knowing up front that a win at the race is out of the question.  I might pull in a 1st for points, but that doesn't mean my name's going to get called when they're announcing the winner.  But since I knew Gallup was different, I went into this race knowing I had a chance.</p>

<p>Early in the week I did some <abbr title="time trial">TTs to see how I was progressing during the year.  I blew away my previous PRs - 6% on the mountain bike course on an hour lap and 14% on a 15 minute minute road bike climb.  I knew I was getting faster.  Those early successes in the week set me up for the weekend.<br />
<br />
Knowing how I had progressed, knowing that I've ridden well at Gallup before, knowing that the Pros were doing their own thing, I went into Gallup knowing I was going to win.  <br />
<br />
A book I've read and listened to on numerous occasions over the last few years is <a href="">The New Psycho-Cybernetics</a>.  Orignally written in 1960 by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, a plastic surgeon, it was the first self-image book.  Dr. Maltz was puzzled at a phenomenon he witnessed time and again as a plastic surgeon.  One patient would have a defect removed and become a "<em>new</em>" person, while someone else could have a comparable surgery performed and still outlook that was based on their "deformed" appearance.  It wasn't that the problem still existed, but in their mind, they <em>knew</em> it still existed.  The mind was still perceiving themselves through the lense of their old self.  No matter how perfect the corrected nose, reduced ears, or any other defect, their mind still thought of themselves with the defect, therefore it became true in their reality.<br />
<br />
Since it was determined the "I think, therefore I am" really was the case, Maltz set out to determine if you could change your reality, the way you perceived things, but changing the way you thought.  He landed on what he called Theater of the Mind; basically imaginative, focused day dreaming.  <br />
<br />
Now, back to Gallup.  I didn't sit on my couch for 30 minutes a day every week imagining a win at Gallup.  I didn't need to.  Because the progress I had made and demonstrated to myself was enough of a confidence booster, I didn't even entertain the idea that anything else could have happened.  <br />
<br />
I went into the race knowing that a Sport racer who had managed to pass me at the previous two races we had both been at upgraded to Expert for this race  That gave me a minute of doubt.  "Well, at least I'll get second."  Once we got hooked up on the course and were actually racing against each other in the flesh, he asked for a pass.  The course was too twisty to let him pass at that point, but once it opened up and I got back into my rhythm I told him he could and he answered by saying that was ok, I was setting a good rhythm then.  That was all the boost I needed to quit thinking about him beating me.  From there on out, it became a matter of who else could I catch and how high could I finish in the overall race.<br />
<br />
This is the first XC race I've gone into feeling really positive about what was coming up.  I knew I had a really good shot at first, and know that regardless I was going to have a good race.  I pulled off the first, and had the best race of the year so far.  So that's my rambly story on how positive thought won me my first race.  <br />
<br />
The last race  I had that I was this mentally prepared for was the <a href="http://www.chupacabras100km.org/en/inicio.html">Chupacapbras 100km</a> in 2003.  I had focused the whole year on that race though, and had spent a lot of time mentally preparing for what it was going to be like.  I think the fact that I was able to put together a race like Gallup this early in the year means I'm going to be a good shape the rest of the year.  Now it's a matter of keeping that mental focus, the positive attitude, training right, and then letting the chips fall where they may.  Hopefully there'll be a few jerseys involved once they hit the ground. :)</abbr></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was emailing back and forth this week with a buddy of mine who's done some cycling coaching and is currently a pretty damn fast dude.  We were talking about what I'm doing training, and he almost instantly zeroed in on my diet.  My current training just needs some little tweaking here and there, but he's suggesting a nearly completely new diet for me.</p>

<p>To start, my breakfast needed some fruits.  No problem, throw a banana and an apple or orange or grapefruit in and I'm set.  Granted, I don't generally eat most of those, but I'm willing to give it a shot.  Next up were salads...</p>

<p>Ugh.  I'm not a green leefy eating kind of guy, but...  I'm going to give it a shot.  So I went to the store the other day and spent about $50 on groceries, nearly all of it fruits and vegatables.  I'm approaching the salads from the same point of view that I tell people who say they don't like beer...  It's because I haven't found one I like yet.</p>

<p>So now I'm going to start making an effort to reach for an apple or some grapes, or something like that went I need my sugar fix mid-afternoon instead of going for a popsicle.  We'll see how it works.</p>

<p>One thing, since I'm not normally a salad type guy I'm not sure what's good.  I know I'm big on thick heavy salad dressings, but if you've got some suggestions, post 'em up.  I'll try just about anything once (except for fried cucumbers :)) ).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Never got those audio blog posts posting, and something weird happened when posting them, so they're not all on here...  Next time maybe.</p>

<p>A full report will come later, but didn't do much of anything in the road race.  Ended up finishing one place out of the money (5th, they paid four deep) in the street sprints.  Those are something else.  Won the Expert 19 - 29 for my first XC win of the season... scratch that.  That was my first XC win ever!  Wow, just dawned on me.</p>

<p>I did what I set out to do: win the XC and get in some good training in the road races.  All in all a good weekend of racing.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/21/four_races_two_days</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yikes... That's a lot of racing.  I fielded a question last week of "is that even safe?"  The answer is yes and no.  Yes, if you're fit and know a little bit about proper recovery; no if you're not and don't.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So my weekend of racing started off with the street sprints at 7:30.  They were a blast, but hard.  This was my first time doing them, along with the first time of a lot of other guys.  You start from a held position like a <abbr title="Time Trial">TT</abbr> and go heart-in-your-throat all out for 350 meters.  It was a double elimination.  I lost, the first round, won the second, and lost the third.  </p>

<p>The first I lost because of inexperience.  I started with the pedal too high in the pedal stroke and the guy got a jump on me I couldn't close down.  The third I had a good start, but the other guy had a better one.  I started closing the gap with about 50 meters to go and he must have seen my shadow or something because he kicked it and I didn't have any more juice.  I was half hearted in that race because I was getting anxious about making the mountain bike start.  I think that mental "well, if I loose this one I'm done" thought might have lead to that loss.</p>

<p>I got to the mountain bike race with 30 minutes to the start.  I was completely warmed up after a morning of warming up on the road bike and those sprints.  I spun around a little bit to get used to the mountain bike again and lined up for the start.  There were a couple of pros down from Durango - two <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/default.aspx">Health Fx</a> guys and one of the <a href="http://www.v2racing.com/3dracing/">3d Racing</a> - that really helped separate out the field.  Going into the single track I think I was about 10th position.</p>

<p>I need to rewind for a second.  When I went to the packet pick-up on Friday to get my race number and such, I noticed one of the sport racers that had actually passed me at the last two races had upgraded (finally - he was putting in Expert times after all) to Expert.  I saw that and commented "great, I'm racing for 2nd now."</p>

<p>Ok, back to the race...  At this point, the only guys in front of me are the half dozen or so pros and a few of the older Experts.  I start cruising, but we're going through a section of trail that's backwards from how I'm used to seeing it.  I would have almost preferred not to know the trail than to know it so well from the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report">12 hour race</a>, because I kept trying to think what was coming up in reverse.  Definitely weird.  My handling skills weren't the best Saturday.  Washed out in some corners, missed two turns completely, just wasn't feeling it in the technical sections, but was really on when I was just cranking up the climbs or in the fast flowy sections.</p>

<p>On one of those washouts, I look back to see if I'm about to get run over by someone, and the newly upgraded Sport racer is there on my wheel.  Ok, so now we've got a race.  I'm pretty sure I'm in the lead at this point, and now I've got the guy I was expecting as competition on my wheel.  Tactics start going through my head.  Every time we get into a twisty section I can hear him right behind me.  When it opens up and I pick up the pace he drops back a little bit.  A weakness!  Every so often I was picking up the pace.  When he's passed me in the other races, he was out off of the front setting his own pace.  I go with the hope that this mini attacks will hurt him and I'll eventually ride off from him.  </p>

<p>I was gapping him by a couple of bike lengths, but then he'd close it back.  I knew he had to be working hard.  Then the course turned up.  I thought he was on my wheel, but them someone calls out for a pass and it's one of the <abbr title="Single Speeders">SS</abbr>'ers coming through.  I've finally gapped him and other racers are coming through.  Then we hit the double switchbacks.  This is the first place I've got to see him on the climbs and now I've opened up about a 75' gap on him.  I keep pushing it knowing there's another steep climb coming up.  By the time we finish the climbing I've opened up about a 100 yard gap on him.</p>

<p>We have to go through that section again, and now I feel I've got a pretty comfortable gap working.  I ease up a little bit and get into a comfortable rhythm knowing that I might have to be ready to attack again if he can close the gap down.  He doesn't.  We come back through the climb again, and then time when I look back I've opened up a 1 - 2 minute gap on him.  Now I start thinking about catching Jen - a Pro for <a href="http://www.titusti.com/">Titus</a> from El Paso who had passed me on the first climbing section.  I could still see her at the top of the climbing section as I was coming up it, so she only had me by about 2 minutes.</p>

<p>I keep kicking it up, but I see I got into a lull now as I look back at my <abbr title="heart rate">HR</abbr> data.  Part of it was being on new trail, but I just couldn't close the gap down.  I did catch one of the older Experts with a half mile to go.  I rode up on his wheel and he asked what category I was racing in, when I told him he told me to go ahead and jump by me.  After I passed him, I could see Jen off in the distance.  Another 2 miles and I might have closed the gap, but she ended up about 1:30 - 2 minutes in front of me.</p>

<p>And I ended up with the win in the Expert 19 - 29 and a top 10 overall in the Experts!  It was my first XC win, my first Expert win, and the first time I've felt "on" during a race this year.  A large part of this was between my ears, but I'll save that for another post - I still have two races to tell you about and I'm already over 1,000 words. :)</p>

<p>The third race of the weekend was a crit Saturday afternoon.  We started at 5:25, just coming off of the heat of the day so I was worried about dehydrating.  That ended up costing me.  I drank too much water during my warm-up, and ended up with some horrible cramps 6 or 7 minutes into the race.  That, combined with some first time crit racers who threw caution to the wind at the start and attacked on the first lap and I was out after 4 or 5 laps.  That's the first race I've had to pull out of this year for "engine" related issues.  Lesson learned though: be smart about drinking before a super high-intensity race.  Well, that and mountain bike racing and crit racing don't mix well.</p>

<p>After curling up in a ball in the shade for half and hour 'til the cramps went away (ok, so I wasn't curled up in a ball, but I did sprawl out in the shade I could find for a bit until the cramps went away), I caught the B and A crits, some super, and hit the sack for some rest and recovery with hopes a come back in the road race.</p>

<p>This morning started off cold - 55 degrees with a wind chill in the upper 40s if you were headed east...  Our race started to the east, of course.  I was feeling a lot better going into this race than I did the crit last night.  They started the women, masters (45+) and the C racers all together, so we had a nice big field to work with.  We had a neutral start and were supposed to stop for five minutes after the neutral start to let the A/B race build up a gap, then we were going to go.  Everybody was slowing to a start, then they motion us through saying we've got enough of a gap.  After a moment of confusion, the field came back together and we settled in to the first climb.</p>

<p>Right as the climb picked up, there was an attack.  I covered it and made the first mistake of the day.  I shouldn't have, because someone else would have.  I ended up pulling through after I covered, then they counter attacked.  I covered that for a little bit, but they kept accelerating, and I didn't have any more in me.  Actually makes me feel good that they viewed me as enough of a threat to try to take me out that early in the race.  After pegging at 28mph on the climb, I sat up and waited for the chase group and got in with them to start working.  </p>

<p>One of the riders with us was the 2nd place in the women's Pro field in the XC race from yesterday.  We had a few masters in the chase group that really knew what they were doing and pulled great, but we had a bunch of passengers.  At one point, one of the masters pulled off the front and went back into the group and started yelling at the others to get up there and work or sit up!  I was glad someone did, because I was getting pretty pissed knowing there was a dozen riders and only 4 or 5 of us were working.</p>

<p>We finally started shelling riders, but there was one C racer that just annoyed me to death.  He sat on the group, then would go to pull through after 2 or 3 minutes of drafting and accelerate as soon as he got to the front.  When he pulled of to move back, I told him to quit accelerating off the front when he pulled through.  That pissed him off and he sat in until the next climb where he attacked right off the bat.  I would have let him gap us by 10 feet, then hung him out to dry, but a few of the masters were trying to make up places, so they kept covering his attacks.  My getting pissed at him and trying to make him work probably cost the two masters in our group 3rd and 4th place.  That's one of the downsides to racing multiple cats in the same race: there's so many different things happening.</p>

<p>On the final climb, I put in an acceleration - wasn't an attack.  The other C racer had just done one of his sit on and then attack at the base of the climb moves, so I waited until he started to drop his speed and made my move.  A couple of the masters came with me, and he managed to hop back on.  At this point, we had another passenger that I had forgot about, a C racer who had got shelled off of the main breakaway.  In the final 400 meters, I finally broke the first guy's spirit and he sat up when I stood up and was hammering out a 30 mph+ sprint to the finish.  I thought I had that place secure when I noticed the other guy who had just been quietly sitting on coming up on my left.  Shit - I'm not going to lose the place sitting up on the line.  I stand back up, get two or three more revolutions of the crank in, and throw for the line to nip him by inches.</p>

<p>I was somewhere in the top ten - I think 6th or 7th, but they haven't posted the full results for the race outside of the guys who finished in the money yet.  I think I managed 5th or 6th in the <abbr title="General Classification">GC</abbr> but I'm not sure.  Had I finished the crit last night, I might have been able to place in the money for the overall.</p>

<p>I was hoping for a few better finishes for in the road races, but accomplished what I set out.  A weekend of some super high intensity training with the added bonus of picking up a win in the XC race.  Like I said, there was a huge mental aspect to that win, but it deserves a post of its own.</p>

<p>I've said before in reviewing their 12 hour race, but Gallup is one of the coolest places to go to bike races.  Considering this is only their second year of promoting races, they're doing a great job.  The <a href="http://www.ci.gallup.nm.us/Mayorpic.htm">Mayor</a> was out at the crit last night helping out like any other volunteer and gave out the awards for all of the road races.  It's great when you have races in small towns like that where they really come out as a whole to support the race.  Some places (cough, Fountain Hills/Phoenix) can have NORBA National races in their backyard and not even mention it in the local paper, much less have the mayor out working as a volunteer at the race.</p>

<p>This next weekend I'm taking off from racing.  I'm tempted to do the <a href="http://www.summitcenterclassic.com/">Summit Center Classic</a> in Flagstaff, but I'd have to drive back Saturday night or risk the ire of a friend for missing her birthday party, so I'll probably just get in some time on the mountain bike before my next race, <a href="http://www.sixhecklers.com/torture.html">La Tierra Torture</a> in Santa Fe.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/accept.mb?senderPk.pkValue=6232&amp;unitSystemPkValue=2&amp;episodePk.pkValue=799943">race data</a> for the XC race:<br />

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Went out and rode the Nova Marathon loop this morning and turned in a personal best by a minute.  Went from 1:04.22 to 1:03.25.  This morning's time was with a heavier hydration back and 3 liters of water instead of 1, plus a mean headwind on some of the faster sections.  I guess that means I am getting a bit faster (finally).  My goal is to have that under 1 hour by nationals and under 55 minutes by the end of the year.  Prior to the Nova race, my previous best was 1:09 and change, so I've already shaved 5 minutes off of my time this year.</p>

<p>I've got to work on my top end speed though.  I start daydreaming and let it slip a bit.  There were a couple of times out there today that I was thinking, "wait, I can go faster" and kicked it up a notch.  Focus, that's what I need to work on.  I've got to stay focused to keep that speed up.</p>

<p>On another note, something I didn't mention in my previous Whiskey posts, but there was what seemed like an inordinate number of <em>hot</em> mountain biker chicks racing Saturday.  All of the guys I talked to were in agreement.  And some strong racers too.  The pro from Colorado who won the Women's Open put in a time that would have been 5th in the men!  And the winner of the Women's <abbr title="Single Speed">SS</abbr> passed me on the climb from hell valley at one point until that shamed me into picking up the pace a bit.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone who knows me probably already knows this, but I determined this morning that something is wrong with me.  My eyes were wide up at 5:30 AM this morning without an alarm clock.  And what do I do?  Roll over and go back to sleep like a normal person would that didn't have to be up that early?  Nope.  I thought "Great, I can eat breakfast and get in a ride before I go in to work this morning.  Sweet!"</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had originally planned to do two races this weekend; the AZ state championship in Prescott on Saturday, then the Gallup High Desert Screamer on Sunday.  That was until Gallup moved their mountain bike race to Saturday.  Gallup is having a big festival this weekend and in addition to the mountain bike race is also having a road race omnium (multiple races for overall points).  At first glance, I thought I wasn't going to be able to do the omnium and the mountain bike race, but a closer inspection of the schedule shows the first stage in the road race happening at 7:30 AM and the mountain bike race starting at 10:00 AM.  Since the first stage is a street sprint (a 350 meter sprint, basically), it'll be over with plenty of time to make it over to the mountain bike start.</p>

<p>So... to make a long post short, I'm going to be racing 4 races in two days this weekend.  Sounds like fun, eh? ;D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... you take a nap and you dream about tactical changes you plan on making at next week's race.</p>

<p>What is the change, you might ask?  I'm thinking of going sans-Camelbak at next week's Gallup to see how I like racing with just a water bottle.  I'm fine with water bottles on the road, but I've never really got it down on the mountain bike.  After yesterday's back breaker, though, I've been kicking around the idea.  The only problem with the dream is I was setting it up to ride withouth the camelbak and had just got started.  I was climbing through a section pretty good and passed someone, so maybe I'll go with it... :)</p>

And yes, I really was just five seconds (if that) from the guy in 27th.  I tried my damnedest to reel him in at the line and have the helmet cam footage to back me up.</p>

<p>Speaking of the helmet cam, I was wearing one for my buddy Vlad of <a href="http://vladfoto.com/main.php">VladFoto</a>.  He'll be putting together a short 2 or 3 minute video of the race using the footage he shot and some of my helmet cam footage.  As soon as he's got it posted I'll put a link up so you guys can share in my debut as a helmet cam dude. :)</p>

        <title>Race Report: Whiskey Off-Road 50 Proof</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/14/race_report_whiskey_off_road_50_proof/"/>
        <updated>2006-05-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/14/race_report_whiskey_off_road_50_proof</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a new definition for the word "sufferfest": <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/wor/wor.htm">Whiskey Off-Road 50 Proof</a>.  Yesterday was the 2006 <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/wor/wor.htm">WOR</a> and I signed up for the <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/wor/worcourse.htm">50 Proof</a> - roughly a 50 mile race through singletrack and jeep roads around Prescott (prounced "press-kit"), AZ.  The race was gruelling.  The downhills were super fast and kept you on your toes the whole time, and if you weren't going down you were going straight up (or so it seemed).  Throw in some heat, and you have a recipe for an epic race.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The race started on <a href="http://www.whiskeyrow.us/">Whiskey Row</a> in downtown Prescott, and turned up from there.  The climbing wasn't too bad until we started to get out of town and hit some brutal 10+% grades on the road.  Little did I know, the day wasn't going to get much better.</p>

<p>Once we got onto the singletrack, I started to find my rhythm.  I had been climbing the paved and jeep roads well up to this point, but my strength for the day was the flats and downhills.  It wasn't the normal everyone rides faster on those, it was I was passing people left and right and just flying.  Short of being off my my bike on a downhill section, I didn't get passed once and passed over a dozen people.  I felt in the zone with my handling skills; I just couldn't climb.</p>

<p>We topped out somewhere around 6,500' on the first climb then hit a 4 mile downhill.  I was flying down this.  I had just passed four riders who were all bunched up when I came into a corner too hot and had my front tire wash out on me.  The one benefit to the whole thing, I was wearing a helmet cam and happened to be recording during the wreck, so I caught a first-person view of what it's like to go down in an XC race.  After that I felt a little tenative on that downhill, but I was able to find my rhythm later.</p>

<p>From there we turned up to climb back up another 2.5 miles to the first check station of the day.  I doused some water on my leg because - get this - the rescue crew that was working, couldn't dispense any medication (no antisceptic spray, no tylenol, no nothing) without putting me in an ambulance and taking me to a hospital.  How crazy is that?  My leg will be fine, but it would have been nice to have not had to wait another 3 hours before I could go to the store and buy some spray for it.  I'll definitely be letting the AZ health department know that their "rules and regulations" are putting people at risk, not helping them.</p>

<p>Back to the race report.  From this check point we headed down to Skull Valley.  The rumor was 12.5 miles down and back up, my GPS showed something closer to 10 on the downhill side though.  At any rate, it was a long downhill followed by a trip back up.  On the way down I passed a good chunk of the field.  First place was about 3 miles up the hill, so about 6 miles in front of me.  In second at this point, and looking stronger than 1st was a <a href="http://www.the-bicycle-company.com/">Bicycle Company</a> jersey.  It turned out to be Adam Hoppe, who went on to catch the guy a minute and a half in front of him and pull out the win.</p>

<p>The climb back up was brutal.  It wasn't technical, it just never ended.  The total climb back past the first check point and up to the top did end up at the 12.5 mile mark.  My legs weren't on a full on cramp, but they were hurting the whole way up.  I had a few sections I had to push just to do something different with my legs.  That climb qualifies as an epic climb, and is something I am definitely going to incorporate into my training.  It's one thing to cover 2,000' - 2,500' on a 5 mile climb, but something totally different to do it over 12 miles.  The whole mental process of the climb becomes different when it lasts that long.  It was something I was definitely not ready.</p>

<p>Back up to the top, I hit the single track and started ripping.  I had been counting the riders that I was passing as I headed down into to Skull Valley and I thought I was just outside the top 50.  At a minimum, I wanted to break into the top fifty, so I found my rhythm on the downhill and started flying.  It was really something else.  There I was, over 4 hours into the race, and I was picking some of the best lines I've picked over trails I had never seen before.  I was very pleased with the result.  I ended up passing a handful of people on the downhill and actually got yelled at once.  :)  </p>

<p>Ok, that requires explanation.  The guy came up to me at the finish line and apologized, and I did to him as well.  I was calling for a pass and even taking the bad lines, trying my best to not have them stop just ot let me by, but by the same token I was riding my brakes hard to stay behind them.  When I climbed as bad as I had and was feeling so "on" when the trails turned down, I couldn't help by try to make up as much time as I could.</p>

<p>My goal for the day had been top 40.  I figured I could easily manage that with no problem and was aiming for a top 20.  I thought I had blown both of either of those by my earlier counting of the riders headed up the hill.  I hadn't passed very many riders on the climb, so I figured at best I was just outside the top 40.  When I checked the results I was floored to see I had pulled 29th.  It wasn't my top 20, but as horrible and slow as I felt on the climbs, I'll take it any day.</p>

<p>I ended up with a time 4:46:08 for 43.66 miles and 7,602' feet of climbing.  I definitely plan on doing it again next year as this race will be a great fitness gauge as to how I'm doing going into the summer.<br />

<p>Went for the first ride last night.  I was hesitant with the new shock.  25% sag seemed a bit high to me and when I got out on the road riding over to the perserve it seemed to bob a lot.  Once I got on the  trail though, I didn't notice it at all.  Actually, using the o-ring as a guide, I could probably increase the sag a bit and still be fine as I didn't even make it 75% of the way into the travel.  It weighs in approx. 27.5, which is where my other one was at so Fisher didn't change up the frame weight.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes the Gods smile down on you.  Remember when I pleaded "<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/05/02/oh_dear_lord_please_let_it_be_under_7_00">Oh dear Lord, please let it be under 7,000 feet...</a>"?  Welp, the starting altitude of this year's national marathon course: eight feet above sea level! :D</p>

<p>The data is available<a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/accept.mb?senderPk.pkValue=6232&amp;unitSystemPkValue=2&amp;episodePk.pkValue=573170">here from MotionBased</a>.  There'll be a lot of short climbing it looks like... Gallup'esque almost.  It's only an 8 mile course with 1300 feet of climbing, but nothing sustained.  The longest "climb" is just over a mile and you only gain 300' compared to the 500' in a half mile at the <a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/accept.mb?senderPk.pkValue=6232&amp;unitSystemPkValue=2&amp;episodePk.pkValue=572334">Coyote Classic</a>.  The format, unless they change it now that it's the Nationals, will be a six hour race, which I think will suit me better... I've always preferred timed races to distance races.</p>

<p>This does mess up my scheduling though.  I had already planned to skip this race.  There's the possibility that if I don't hit both of the Utah marathons someone could sneak past me for the series title.  That means I'll be doing Park City and Sonoma back to back, or skipping Park City hoping someone doesn't beat me out at Brain Head.  Decisions, decisions...</p>

<p>I'm no expert on downhill forks, but I don't think a 1/8" bulge around at 1" burst in a tube is a good thing.  Geez... trouble really does come with company.  In case you can't tell, that's a quarter in the picture...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've pissed somebody upstairs off.  And I mean in a big kind of way.</p>

<p>So yesterday evening I decided I'm going to finally get that synthetic chain lube off of my road bike and switch to some dry lube.  I've been meaning to since I moved here, but I just havne't gotten around to it.  So I get the chain cleaned up and go to get the gunk off of the chain rings when the small ring catches on the rag...  the finish is peeling off!</p>

<p>I haven't been home today to do much research into what's causing that, but it might mean a new chain ring.  No big deal, but annoying just the same.  The bike only has 1000 or so miles on it.</p>

<p>So, this morning I pull out old trusty, my bomb proof Bullit that nothing can happen to (the way I ride it anyway).  I knew one of the seals was leaking a bit, but no biggie as I just ordered the new <a href="http://www.enduroforkseals.com/id53.html">enduro seals</a>.  It won't hurt it to take it on one more ride...</p>

<p>When I got up to Flagstaff and unload the bike, the leaking fork leg was extended out an extra 3"!  No, I didn't just drive 2+ hours to unload my bike, load it back up and drive back home.  I fiddle with it a bit and determine that once the axle is in place it'll be held there so it'll be good enough for one ride.  Thankfully, it was.  </p>

<p>But still, four bike, four issues.  All in two and a half weeks!  This is crazy; I haven't had this much trouble with bikes in... well, forever.  Seriously, I'm thinking one of the bike gods has it in for me.  Ew... I know, it's the god of the 26" wheel!  He's got it out for me with all my 29'er talk.</p>

<p>I did fall in love today, bad fork and all.  The trails in Flagstaff are unbelievable.  Anything that has a trail who's nickname is Organ Donor (the official name is Cat Walk), has to be awesome.  I don't think I've ever done a 6 mile decent before.  But those trails were crying for a 29'er.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even if that waiting is a little impatiently.  So as I described <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/04/20/working_like_a_pro">here</a>, my trusty 29'er broke two weeks ago.  On Wednesday I got a call from the shop, "I've got bad news."  Oh no, they're not going to warranty it.  I'm never buying another Fisher again!  "You're not going to have your bike in time for the race.  They literally don't have any frames in the US; they're waiting on a ship from Taiwan to come in so they can get one ready for you."  The race in question is the Whiskey Off-Road, which I had told them I was hoping to have the bike back in time for.  He offerred to set me up with a <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/bikes/series.asp?series=am-fs">Fat Possom</a>, but that's not a 50 mile race friendly bike.</p>

<p>So I'm stuck with the Spider, except it's bearings on the one of the rear pivots went out shortly before Cloudcroft (felt like I was cornering on a flat all weekend).  Under the massive pressure of my quads, I could completely flex the BB shell and move it several millimeters to the left.  Ok, so that was the bearing being out, but it was still impressive looking. :)  I ordered a bearing kit from <a href="http://enduroforkseals.com/">Chris</a> in Tucson so I'll be fixing that this weekend.</p>

<p>But I still hated to see my <a href="http://www.speeddream.com">beautiful wheels</a> from Dave sitting in the garage, so I've been scouring the internet looking for a deal on a frameset (or maybe frame and fork).  I found a couple of great deals on Paragons, but they were all the wrong size.  There was one deal on a new 292 frame/crank/bb, but the guy was asking $750 on the buy it now.  He had it listed on MTBR for $700, and the bidding started at $500, so I emailed him this morning and offerred to split the difference, $600.  No response... Then, just a little while ago I happened to run one more search for Fisher bikes to see what came up, and I found a used (one ride) 292 frame/crank/bb for under $400!  Score! B)</p>

<p>Man, I'm so glad I didn't go to LA.  I'd be asleep in a hotel room right now pissing away the $400 that just picked up a new 29'er frame!  So now I'm hoping the seller ships tomorrow (he's in UT - which, oddly enough, is where my 293 was born and raised before I got it).  That'll mean I should get it with enough time to build it up and get in a ride or so to tweak it before throwing it into Whiskey.  But even if I don't have it by Whiskey, I'll have it in time for Gallup, and <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report">I know how big of a deal a 29'er is there</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got this email from <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/news/user/story.php?id=2225">USACycling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Colorado Springs, Colo. (May 2, 2006)?Due to massive snowfall on Mammoth Mountain this winter, USA Cycling will be relocating its 2006 Mountain Bike National Championships scheduled for July 20-23.</p>

<p>?Looking at our snowpack today, I can confidently say we are unable to host a mountain bike event to the quality we are all accustomed to,? commented Bill Cockroft, senior vice president of operations at Mammoth Mountain. ?It was a difficult decision, but ultimately we believe we owe it to the mountain bike community to make sure the event continues at the level and standards expected by USA Cycling.?</p>

<p>USA Cycling is currently negotiating with several venues to replace Mammoth Mountain and a decision is expected to be announced shortly.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be too much to ask for this to happen at a lower altitude...  Unfortunately, I'm thinking this might mean it heads even further up.</p>

<p>My guesses are for the relocation are Durango, somewhere in Utah, or possibily Angelfire.  I don't think Angelfire has had a Nationals race before, but they do have a World Cup caliber setup as they did a WC race last year.  The only kicker, do they have a course capable of handling a marathon without getting people dizzy from going in circles?</p>

I like to think we've just been missing each other all these months, but the cynical side of me thinks it might be the $3.05+ a gallon for gas that's making people think twice about cranking up to drive across the street.  Three cheers for record oil profits. ;D</p>

<p>At any rate, I go from having seen no one walking to the store from my complex to four people in one night!  An interesting side note, we were all under 30.</p>

        <title>Cloudcroft results</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/01/cloudcroft_results/"/>
        <updated>2006-05-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/05/01/cloudcroft_results</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, yesterday was a rough race.  Physically, it's the toughest I've endured.  The course wasn't technical in the least, and the climbing, though there was a lot of it, wasn't that bad, but still I felt like I was going to pass out after the race.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>My goal for the day was to try to accelerate and stick with the lead as long as I could, bad decision when there are a handful of pro and semi-pro racers in your field.  My heart rate spiked on the first climb out of town and I never fully recovered from that.  I thought my hour long warm-up would have me ready for that, but I wasn't ready the big ring action and hypoxic conditions.</p>

<p>I slugged my way around the course, trading pulls with Shannon, a pro from El Paso who was  back in her first race of the year after breaking several bones in a nasty crash back in January.  I got out on the jeep road which I was really looking forward too with her, she pulled for a few then motioned for me to pull through.  I did, but a minute later when I was ready for her to pull through I had already started to put a gap on her.  I knew one of the guys in my category was up in front of me, so I just kept the pressure on.  I got into Bailey's Canyon and passed that guy like he was sitting still.  I love that downhill, even though I ran out of gears the first two times down it.</p>

<p>As I turned into the mile long march back up to Cloudcroft, I heard a voice from behind say "good job, Travis."  Shannon had made contact on the downhill and was with me on the climb.  She was out of shape from being laid up and I was hurting from the lack of oxygen, so we just got into a rhythm and started climbing and keeping each other company.  About half way up the climb, I had to stop and ditch my long-sleeve jersey.  Shannon was in sight all the way to the single-track, but I lost touch with her there and never made it again.  The guy who ended up taking 2nd in the Pro/Expert 19-29 also passed me while I was re-arranging my clothing.</p>

<p>When I topped out of the single-track, a left turn wasn't marked and the last year I raced the course in 2003, it was a right turn.  I turned right, got in my big ring, and started motoring back into town.  I thought it was weird that there wasn't any flagging on the way in and that the guy who was just in front of me seemingly disappeared.  When I made it back up to the ball field, I was told I missed the turn.  Turns out, I took the long route distance wise, but it was probably quicker because it wasn't single-track.  It took a couple of minutes to figure out what was going on before I finally just asked if I could go and have them tell me what to do next lap.  All in all, I figure I cost myself about 8 minutes on that lap between the delay at the start/finish and the jersey.</p>

<p>The second lap I started hurting.  Nothing bad, but I was in easier gears on the flat sections, and it had only been the climbs that were hurting me.  A couple of the sports off of the front made contact with me during my second lap.  I could hold them off until we turned up.  I made it out at the bottom of Bailey's the second time and could see the guy I thought I was racing with for last place.  I was closing in on him the whole time up the jeep road until the last 1/4 mile when my back just said no-more.  I had to hop off of the bike for a minute and push just to stretch some different muscles.  I got back on and could just see him ducking into the single-track at the top of the jeep road.  I tried to make contact, and got within a 100 feet of him as we topped out onto the jeep road before the last climb to the finish, but lost contact with him as I didn't have any juice left for some big ring tempo riding and he apparently had enough to stay out of sight of me.</p>

<p>I rolled into the start finish asking if I was DQ'd for missing the turn or should I keep going.  I was almost hoping I was DQ'd.  That's not by choice.  Especially since the course wasn't clearly marked when I came through.  I could have stopped racing and felt good about it.  It wouldn't have been a <abbr title="Did Not Finish">DNF</abbr> of choice.  But I was told I was good and to keep racing.  Ok, so just one more lap.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.</p>

<p>I had to stop at least three times that I remember to get blood back to my head.  I was getting light-headed, nauseous, my legs were cramping, my heart felt like it was going to explode even though it was at only 60% - 65% of it's max (at Phoenix altitude, I can normally ride 85% - 90% in a sustained effort), I was bonking... without the full-on, body-seizing cramps or vomiting or passing out.</p>

<p>I made it out to the jeep road where I had dropped Shannon by accident earlier in the day and could barely turn over the big ring.  I ended up having to drop back to the middle ring just to keep from cramping.  Bailey's was still fun, but I had a head wind that made the descent work.  I was pedaling the whole way just to keep a decent pace.  As we turned up I saw a few people up in front of me.  Though I'm not positive, I think one of them was in my category.  As we started, I was closing a little bit of a gap.  By the time I had made it 2/3rd of the way up I had closed down half the gap, but my body was done.  I ended up little-ringing everything but the descents the rest of the way in to the start finish, and grabbing a seat on someone's tail-gate at the start finish to let the oxygen start flowing back into my brain again.</p>

<p>That makes two races that have pushed me to the limit.  This felt worse that Gallup.  At least there I knew I was racing for a spot on the podium.  In Cloudcroft, I thought there were five guys in my category and I thought I had one behind me.  Turns out I did have one behind me, but there were only 4 of us and he DNF'd early on in the race.  Apparently, I wasn't the only one that the blistering pace at the start broke.  I talked to a few guys who got caught up in that and DNF'd after the first lap completely wasted.</p>

<p>But, I finished...  Sometimes, that's all it takes.  I ended up in 3rd for the 19-29 Pro/Expert with 2nd place points for the Expert series.  Unofficially (by my tallying anyhow) that moves me into sole possession of 1st in the points series for New Mexico.  This makes 4 races in a little over a month with 4 podium finishes.</p>

<p>Next up won't be so forgiving for "just finishing."  Last year's <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/past/worpast/wor_2005_results.html">Whiskey Off-Road</a> had over 100 racers in the Open Men category.  I'm shooting for sub 4:30, which will put me in the top 40.  I would like to be in the top 20%, which will require a time of 4:10 mas y menos.  I'll be running a helmet-cam for a video that <a href="http://vladfoto.com/main.php">VladFoto</a> is shooting of <a href="">Epic Rides'</a> events, so I don't know how much that'll effect my time.</p>

        <title>Swicegood pulls out of Southridge</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/27/swicegood_pulls_out_of_southridge/"/>
        <updated>2006-04-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/27/swicegood_pulls_out_of_southridge</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You saw it here first.   Even before <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/">Cycling News</a> picked it up!  I've decided I'm not going to do the LA/Fontana/Southridge/California race next weekend.  After looking at how much I was going to spend on the race, I decided it just wasn't worth it.  To race the Marathon and XC races was going to run me around $500 for the weekend, and that's if I was extremely conservative with my spending once I'm out there.  </p>

<p>I'm not sure why this venue was picked.  No camping added nearly $200 to the cost of the trip, and that was if I stayed at a Motel 6!  It's great to try to include a diverse cross section of trails and such, but LA seems like a stretch.  It would be one thing if the venue was setup for racing and had camping available and the like, but to put everyone there on their own just doesn't do much for me.</p>

<p>Which actually brings me to another point, what's the point of the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/">NMBS</a>?  If it's to promote the sport of mountain biking, my one experience with it didn't seem to do that.  Look at last year's standings, the only ones that hit more than one or two races were the pros or people lucky enough to have a bunch of races in their state (cough... Utah).  I really feel for anyone east of Denver if they're into the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/guide/marathon.shtml">Marathon</a>.  The closest race they'll have is Park City in July.</p>

<p>I'll probably do a few of the other NMBS races this year just because I would like to try to get the Marathon Series Championship, but with so many smaller races around the southwest that are charging $25 - $35 and are paying out to the top 3 riders instead of $65 - $80 and a congratulations when you're done, I just don't know that I see the point.</p>

<p>I'm hearing grumblings about this at the races I've been to.  If <abbr title="National Off-Road Bike Association">NORBA</abbr> doesn't get their stuff together and start providing better events at the national level, I think they're going to slowly become irrelevant.</p>

<p>On another note, I will be hitting Cloudcroft's <a href="http://www.highaltitude.org/">High Altitude Classic</a> this weekend.  I had actually thought about racing in the sport DH race, but they scheduled the XC and the DH races on the same day, so it'll be XC only for me.  Turns out I'm tied for 1st place in the 19-29 Experts in NM, so I'm hoping for a good race.  Hopefully there'll be enough pros so they have their own category and I won't have to get beat by - err, I mean race against Dax again. :)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today's just been weird for me.  I don't hardly want to look at a computer for some reason and I've got no clue why.  I'm thinking it's a vitamin/mineral deficiency of some sort...  Got to remember to take vitamins after a weekend of riding like I did this past one.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in my blahs today I got to thinking about what makes a pro mountain biker a pro mountain biker.  Is it the confidence to quit their job, move to the mountains, and try to scrap out a living while they ride?  Is it all genetics; predetermined before we role up to the line?  Is it just the opportunity to?  Or is it just raw want to?  Day's like today (low 80s) make we wish that all I had to do was get up and hop on the bike for 4 or 5 hours or longer and just ride.  So what do you have to do to get there?  What do <em>I</em> have to do to get there?</p>

<p>Man, it's only been two weeks since my last race and I'm feeling withdraws.  I can't wait for <a href="http://www.highaltitude.org/">Cloudcroft</a> this weekend.</p>

<p>So today me and a few other mountain bikers (read: crazy people) from Fountain Hills took off for <a href="http://trails.mtbr.com/cat/united-states-trails/trails-arizona/trail/PRD_164548_4513crx.aspx">Mount Ord</a>.

<p>Took the bike <a href="http://www.bicycleshowcase.com/">Bicycle Showcase</a> and was told they just need to send the frame off and they're certain <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/">Fisher</a> will warranty it.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I decided to ditch the weekly crit in favor of some climbing tonight.  Was going to hit Sunrise, ride up and meet with the guys from the normal Wednesday night ride, head back down the mountain with them, then ride back up one more time and come back down the east slope and head home.</p>

<p>I make it up, late, of course, but that's the way I like it.  That way I can set my own pace on the climb and not feel like I should be waiting or trying to keep up.  I make it to the top, start heading back down with Dave of <a href="http://www.speeddream.com/">Dave's Wheels</a> (who was flying down the mountain) and make it to the parking lot.  We're sitting there talking before I head back up for my second climb (yes, I'm a glutton for pain) when Dave points out a nice little crack I've got going on in my frame.  Looking it over I realize that there's only maybe a half-inch in the top tube that is keeping it from cracking all the way through.</p>

<p>So, I've got to make it to a Fisher dealer tomorrow and see what I can do.  I just spent last week pulling all my lightweight stuff off of the Spider to setup the 29'er for racing and I'm less than a week and a half from my next race!  Hopefully, <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/">Fisher</a> will warranty it or at least give me some sort of deal on a new frame.  Maybe they can hook me up with a deal on a new <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/bikes/bike_detail.asp?series=trail-29er&amp;bike=Supercaliber29">Supercaliber 29'er</a> frame as a replacement.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sunscreen is your friend.  It still doesn't hurt like a normal sunburn, but I have the pattern of a Pnuemo helmet on my head.  Sunday I went out for a road ride in the middle of the day and didn't wear any sort of cap under my helmet.  When I got out of the shower after the ride I noticed my head was awfully red, then it dawned on me.  Oops...</p>

<p>In other news, I'm one ride away from having as many rides in 2006 as I managed in 2005 and hitting the 100k vertical feet mark.  Tonight I'm climbing on the mountain bike, so I'm sure I'll get that in no problem.</p>

        <title>What to do when your weekend doesn't work out as planned?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ride, of course.  I should be somewhere in New Mexico right about now having finished up the second race in the NMORS, the <a href="http://www.socorro.com/ssr/coyote/">Cerrillos del Coyote</a>, instead, I'm at home.  Yesterday didn't go as planned and with the time difference between AZ and NM, I would have gotten into Socorro about 2 AM with a race start time of 8:20.  Five hours sleep and a Pro/Expert race just don't seem to go together.  So, at 6 PM last night, having just finished up the day's work (that started at 6:45 no less so I could get out earlier), I opted to stay home for the weekend.  Or at least closer to home.</p>

<p>Last night I was pissed.  Mount Ord, Sedona to Flag and back, just playing in Sedona.  I had to do something big today.  Then it dawned on me.  <a href="http://www.fountainhillsguide.com/rec_hike_mcdmtn_thom.html">Thompson Peak</a>.  I can ride from the house, get in a couple thousand feet of climbing, and use up all this extra energy.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up ready.  I had pysched myself up this whole week for the race plus I had the whole wishing I was somewhere else thing going so I was ready.  Pulled out my trusty beast and started up.  I made it all the way to the Dixie Mine, where a group of what I guess were volunteers were clearing out some underbrush.  A park ranger'ish guy (no badge) informed me that I was trespassing on the road I was on (in a county park, mind you) and committing at least three class 2 misdemeanors.  To myself I'm thinking "along with the dozen other hikers I passed on the way up here".</p>

<p>Plan B - head out to the park and just get miles in.  Boy did I.  I was on pavement for maybe 2 or 3 miles and put in over 47 miles.  I did Pemberton clockwise.  Talk about mind numbing.  A great low-effort climb.  In about 3 miles you put in 500~ feet of climbing.  I was just cruising along on that climb when a train of three riders passed me.  It dawned on me that I was just putting along so I hopped on with them and followed them to the downhill portion of the trail and were going too slow for my tastes.  It's amazing what having someone in front of you can do for your speed.</p>

<p>All said and done, I was pleased with the stats for today.  Would have preferred to have been racing, but...</p>

<ul><li>Total Moving Time: <em>4:22:18</em></li>
<li>Total Distance: <em>47.28 mi</em></li>
<li>Total Climbing: <em>4,310</em></li></ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I live for rides like last night.  A little over two hours, over 5,000 feet of climbing, and an awesome sunset.  It started around 5 with the intent to hit as many climbs as I could in an hour to an hour and a half, basically until I was cooked...  instead of being done, I just kept riding.  </p>

<p>Over 1:30 into the ride, I headed out to King's Tree to Palomino to do the last climb of the day.  It starts out with a 100 yards of 10%, then settles back into a 2% until you cross Fountain Hills Blvd and it kicks back up to another 3% - 4% for the rest of the climb, another mile and a half or so.  As I made it to the top, the sunset was in full bloom.  The entire world - at least the part of it I could see - was awash in a firey orange that shifted to a red as a descended back to the appartment - riding from the sunset.  </p>

<p>I have got to get me a small camera for riding...</p>

<p>The best part, two hours and thirteen minutes into the ride I still wasn't cooked.  Felt like I had climbed 5k, but I wasn't completely done for the day.    </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Damn it, damn it, damn it.  My last lap time by my computer was 1:20 -  that was actual ride time.  My actual lap time: 1:33.  Second places last lap time: 1:41.  And how far out of second were we at the end of the day?  7 minutes!  Uggh!</p>

<p>Of course, it could also be said that my Spider and my late start cost the race.  My first lap racing time was 1:24, so was second's, but I had a three minute late start so my official time was 1:27.  My second lap ended up at 1:31 officially (1:30 and change of riding for me), and we were 13 minutes out of second at that point.  Assuming I would have put in a time around 1:15 on the 29'er, we would have been in second at that point.</p>

<p>Who knows, I could have hit the wall if I went out too fast on that last lap.  Being as spent as I was, I could have gotten sloppy and wrecked or flatted again... but still.  Damn it, damn it, damn it.</p>

        <title>Dawn 'til Dust Race Report</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report/"/>
        <updated>2006-04-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No, that's not a typo.  I'm moving to a renaming of the Gallup 12 hour race from Dawn 'til Dusk to Dawn 'til Dust.  I'm still coughing up dust!</p>

<p>Warning: long winded mountain bike race recap.  If you're not into that sort of thing, you can skip this post.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>What a weekend.  The morning started off early enough, 5 AM.  By 6:15 we were at the course setting up an easy up canopy.  Before I knew it, the racers meeting was happening and I realized I still had a few things to get squared away (Camelbak, <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">eGel</a>, the like).  I wasn't too worried about a long warm-up, I had 12 hours to get warmed up in, but I did want to get loose.</p>

<p>So after I get back and get everything together I head over to the starting line, about a 1/3rd of mile away.  The start was a mass start with a 1/3rd mile of jeep road to the singletrack.  I knew it was going to be bad and was planning on staying in the first 20 or so to keep from getting tied up.  Well, it didn't quite work out that way.  As I started down the 300 yard hill at the start, I saw a mass of riders coming up the road.  Shit, I missed the start.  I didn't know if I need to check in or anything, so I went to the start, asked if I need to check in or just turn around and go and was told to turn around and go.  I big ringed that climb trying to make up as many places as I can - helped a little bit, but I still got into the single-track with a march of the ants.  Ugh!  My own fault, completely, but that only made it more frustrating.  I did get a few "nice pass"es as I passed riders going through the solo pits, which helped the moral.</p>

<p>In all the confusion and pre-race jitters, I forgot to eat breakfast.  I remembered this somewhere in my first lap.  I didn't even eat a gel to start off with.  Man, I'm off to a great start.  Thankfully, my mind was kept occupied by looking for lines to pass people with so I didn't concentrate on it too much.  I seriously think I passed somewhere between 30 and 40 people the first lap.  Starting in the back when you're feeling good isn't cool, I kept getting jammed up.  I can't blame them for not wanting to pull off to the side the second I ride up on them; they're there to race too afterall.  </p>

<p>At the first turn around I realize I haven't had any gel.  So much for my 300 - 500 calories per lap plan.  It wasn't until later laps that I realized it was nearly impossible to eat on that course.  You were constantly on your toes dodging rocks, trying to keep from sliding out in sandy corners, or getting some major flowy 20mph+ singletrack in.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I just adjust.  My plan for the morning was to put in two laps to start with and then hand off to partner.  It was going to be in the upper 20s when the race started and I didn't want to stop until it had warmed up into at least the upper 30s/lower 40s.  I did manage to keep that goal.  I put in a 1:24 lap time (by my computer, I was at 1:27'ish officially because of my late start) so I'm feeling good.  The crowd on the singletrack has started to thin, so I'm not getting stuck behind people as much.  I make it to the turn around in about 38 minutes and when I go to take my card something happened with the hand-off and I eat it hard.  The card was for a poker hand.  At the half way point of each lap you got a poker card and the best poker hand won a prize.  Anyhow, for those of you who noticed the card hand off location change from the early morning, I'm the reason.</p>

<p>I dust myself off get back up, guilt the guy into giving me an Ace (my second of what would become three) and take off.  A hundred yards back into it and I realize my bars and off center.  I didn't want to start pulling tools out, so I jump off the bike, wedge the wheel between my legs and start yanking on the bar.  I know I've got 20 - 25 minutes 'til I'm off for a lap so I know if I can get it close enough to make it back and I'll get it fixed when I get back.  About half the way back I notice my front wheel washing out.  Great, I'm loosing air pressure in my front tire.  Ok, don't take any gambles, make it back... only 5 minutes or so.  Bad move, and one I won't make again.</p>

<p>About 90 seconds from the finish, I come around a corner, catch a rock wrong and rip a hole in the tire.  I'm so close now I might as well walk/run it in - it'd be just as fast and I'm not up on the next lap.  Plenty of time to fix it.  I ended up with a 1:30 even with the flat knowing that I cost myself at least 5 minutes by not taking the 60 seconds to shoot some more air into the tire.  Thankfully, I brought my 29'er to the race, even with it's shifting screwed up, so I decide to see if the guys at the <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI</a> tent can get me going.  Sure enough, 15 minutes and some new cable housing later I'm back in business with my big bike.</p>

<p>One of my goals for the weekend was to race a lap or two with both my Spider and my 293 and see which one felt better and which one I had faster times on.  Having a hole in the tire of my Spider gave me the excuse to get the shifting working on the 293 and get it out on the course.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm planning on having 1:45 minutes or so off time between laps.  I decide to head down to the staging area a little early and hang out.  1:35 she comes barreling through.  Cool, 10 minutes faster a lap than I expected and now I start thinking about podium places.  The only problem is now I'm on my big bike which I figure will slow me down about 5 minutes.  Man, was I wrong.</p>

<p>I was ripping through the first section of the trail, the part I was worried about.  The climbs were nothing, and all of the little technical sections that I had been dabbing on earlier in the morning on the Spider were child's play.  Couple that with the fact that I've felt comfortable recently with a lower cadence that a 29'er has, and I was flying.  I got to the turn around in 34 minutes shaving 4 minutes off my time and I hadn't even gotten to the fast part of the course yet where the 29'er would shine!</p>

<p>At this point it dawns on my that no one has passed me, but I keep passing people.  I'm feeling awesome and when I look down at my computer and realize I'm coming in under 1:15 I've got a smile on my face that last 1/4 mile.  I ended up with a time of 1:13.02, and much to my pleasure, I've beat my partner to the staging area.  As I roll up to the tent, she's hopping on her bike and does a double-take, "What are you doing back already?"  </p>

<p>Right about now all of the problems from earlier in the day start to melt away and I start thinking up ways to sell the Spider (it's a medium frame if you're interested).  Since I'm not eating as much as I should on the course, I start making sure I've got plenty of food in me at the breaks.  At 1:20 I head back up to the staging area and start waiting.  Around 1:40 she rolls in and I'm off before she has a chance to tell me anything.</p>

<p>Lap 4 now I'm feeling just as good as I was the last lap, even a bit more confident as I'm pushing harder gears through a couple of the sections and big ringing some of the shorter climbs.  The momentum on a 29'er will carry you up just about anything if you keep with it.  I make it to the turn around at 34 minutes and change again.  I felt great the whole lap back and really start to kick it up as I come in for the home stretch.  Again, nobody passed me the whole lap.  I'm really feeling it now.  I come in with a 1:13.27!</p>

<p>As I roll up to the staging area, I'm greeted by "Do you have another lap in you?"  In my delirium, I didn't notice she didn't have her bike or her helmet.  "Yeah, I've got one or two more in me, after you."  "No, I'm done, I barely made it back last lap, but you were gone so fast I didn't have a chance to tell you."  Well, shit... there goes my pacing out the window.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of apologies and some gel, I head back out for another lap knowing where in the top 5 somewhere - her goal is to find out where we're at so I know whether another lap is needed and try to get some food in her so she can take the last lap.  I'm feeling horrible.  I had been pacing myself for a little bit off of the bike and some refueling, and my mind starts reminding me of that.  Even though I don't feel as fast as I was, I make it to the turn around in about 37 minutes and still haven't been passed by anyone on the course.  To help with the mental boast, there's been someone in sight every few minutes and I'm passing them like they're sitting still.  I come back in to the timing tent at 1:17.  I can't believe I'm still turning faster times than my fresh morning laps on the Spider even though I feel as badly as I do.  </p>

<p>I come back to find out we're in 3rd now and not sure where 4th is, though we know they're on the same lap and but they haven't come through yet.  I've got 1:35 to make the last lap in and have it count, and all I have to do is stay in front of people.  One Red Bull, and a few minutes in a chair later I'm off again - 6th lap of the day and 3rd straight.  Ouch.  When I left for the last lap the decision was left up to me.  Finally deciding to go out for the last lap, I said I'm going to lose a podium on the course, not because I sat out the last lap.  </p>

<p>I feel completely dead.  One of the team guys who was out for his first or second lap of the day comes blazing past me in the first ten minutes.  There goes my passless streak.  It doesn't bother me too much, though, because I'm still reeling other riders in.  As fatigue starts to set in, I start telling myself that "fatigue is only mental, fatigue is only mental".  If you heard someone pass you mumbling this, that was me.  I kept this up for a few minutes, and before I knew it I'm feeling back.  I still wasn't mashing the gears, but it's not killing me like it was.  At the turn around, I turn in something around 40 minutes.  I start calculating my time out and realize I'm probably in line for something around 1:20.  I realize I've got less than 30 minutes to go and I start giving it everything I've got.  </p>

<p>It was somewhere along the trip back that I started to realize what <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=suitcase+of+courage+phil+liggett">Liggett's been talking about</a>.  My legs felt like they were going to explode, but I literally threw everything I had into them knowing that a podium was on the line.</p>

<p>Painful as that sounds, it was actually great.  One of the biggest mental blocks I've had is pushing myself to the brink of breaking.  I've admitted that one of my weaknesses as an Expert racer is my unwillingness to redline and hurt for like you're required to at that level.  These last two laps were the first time I've forced myself into that place of constant pain and been able to keep it there knowing a race is on the line.</p>

<p>But I digress.  I'm still working with one person having passed me in the last three laps.  As I passed one guy when he hoped off of his bike I said "Aren't you glad this is almost over?"  He said something about that being the end of his day, he was shortcutting back and done.  That and a few more random passes - now the course is virtually empty - and I'm starting to feel good again.  I know my time is going to be slower than the last few laps, but it's still going to be respectable and in under the time limit so I'm feeling great.  About a mile out from the finish, I hear "rider back".  One of the <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/">Team HealthFX</a> guys comes barreling past me.  I try to latch on in case he's somehow racing co-ed duo, and passing me for a place, but he was going too fast.  Turns out he was on a male duo team and took first.</p>

<p>As I come into the final stretch there's a guy who gets onto the final 150 yards of road about 50 feet in front of me.  I don't know who I'm chasing for 2nd, but by god if this guy is going to beat me to it if he's it.  I put the hammer down and manage to pass the guy before the line to a screaming partner...  "Travis, you're awesome!  You got us second!"  I couldn't believe it...  The pain of the race, the relief of being done, and the emotion of picking up a place on the last lap... I just need to lay down.  I hand off my bike, found some open dirt, and collapse.</p>

<p>I turned in my last lap at 1:20.59.  Feeling as though I was going to puke a couple of times and having my legs screaming at me for over an hour and twenty minutes I still turned in a time faster than either of the two on my Spider.  I'm completely spent.  With that final sprint for the line (which wasn't for a place, but I wasn't going to take the chance) I left it all on the course.  I've done 75.9 miles in 8:01.45 and climbed some 10,000 feet (I think - it'll be my first 10k day if it was).  </p>

<p>When it was all said and done, we ended up in 3rd out of 9 or 10 teams.  Considering that only two of the laps were put in by my "partner", I'll take it.  Based on the times I did put in, I think I would have stood a good shot at a top 5 in  the solo category.  I won't know though, at least until next year :) </p>

<p><strong>In review...</strong><br />
So now that I've rambled on about the minutiae of the race for a small volume, the review.</p>

<p>The Gallup course is awesome.  It keeps you on your toes the entire time, and makes for an extremely challenging endurance course.  It's not like Old Pueblo where dirt roads are conventiently scattered through out to give you a chance to recoup and refuel, instead it throws you a switchback after a sandy turn after a 25% grade climb with a rock hop at the top after a switchback on a ledge with a 100' drop on the side.  It's a crazy kind of fun that only a mountain biker could get a kick out of.  </p>

<p>Last year they were surprised by the turnout, this year I think they doubled in size.  I see Gallup quickly becoming one of the premier endurance race courses in the southwest.  It's within a day's drive of Denver, Tucson, Phoenix, and El Paso, not to mention being right down the street from Durango and Albuquerque.  I think once they've got it worked out and start really pushing the race, they'll just continue to get bigger.</p>

<p>With all the good, there were a few things I would change.  First, they did a mass start.  Of course, I was on the bad end of a mass start, but for a race like this I think a LeMans is the way to go.  Having that 1/4 mile run to start the race really helps seperate out the racers from the riders, as only the people who are really gunning for a good place are going to put in that effort.  Of course, when you're late to the start, it doesn't matter of it's a mass start or a LeMans, you're still <abbr title="Dead... umm, Frigging? Last">DFL</abbr>.</p>

<p>The other thing I would look at is the way they handle the relays.  At all the other endurance races I've been to and participated in, they use batons.  When you come into the timing tent, you have to show your baton, then it's passed off to the next rider, who repeats it the next time they come through.  With only one baton per team, it makes sure only one rider is on the course at a time.  Without that, it would be too easy for someone to have sent another rider out a few minutes before their teammate got back.  The baton removes that temptation.</p>

<p><em>Added as an afterthought: One final thing, it would make the race longer, but I would race for 12 hours plus.  Basically, every lap you start before the 12 hour mark counts instead of every lap you finish before the 12 hour mark.  On a course this size, that adds an extra 1 - 1.5 hours of racing and makes the final strategy that much more important.  Of course, this makes the race that much longer, and it would also start putting riders out as the sun sets.  The way I've always seen races that can end with you on the course after sunset is they set a cutoff that you have to go out with a light if you leave.  For this race, I'd make it leaving after 6 PM require a light.<br />
<br />
These three</em> changes would bring the race in line with <a href="http://grannygear.com/AMTRI/index.shtml">AMTRI</a> and make it run just like every other endurance race out there, taking it up an extra knotch.</p>

<p>All that said, this is an awesome race that's put on by the city chamber of commerce.  For $30 - 40 a person (depending on category) they give you beer, food, a 12 hour race, and a t-shirt.  When you participate in the bigger national races paying $65 - $100 to race and see the difference in what you get for your money when you're racing in a small regional race, it really makes you wonder where racing is headed.  Is it to the big commercial races that treat you like the # on your number plate, or the smaller local races where you can call the promoter up on her cell phone the week before a race and ask questions?</p>

<p>Assuming my body quits hurting between now and then, next weekend is week 4 of racing for me.  <a href="http://www.socorro.com/ssr/coyote/">Socorro's Cerrillos del Coyote</a>, the #2 race in the <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org">NMORS</a> series.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've spent the evening getting my bike ready for the race, the only problem is that I'll only be taking one.  I had hoped to take my 29'er and switch off between the two bikes and see what I thought.  After last week where I felt so much more comfortable at a lower cadence, I was really looking forward to this experiment, but it's not going to happen.</p>

<p>At Nova, about 2 1/2 laps into the race my shifting in the rear went, when I got through and inspected the bike I found out that my cable housing had gone south.  A brand new one I might add.  I never got around to fixing it for the Coyote, so I only took my Spider.  Tonight, I cut new housing for it, got it all worked out, then started checking the shifting, it was still gone.  On further inspection, it looks like it's just a matter of how the cable housing is routed.  I thought I might find some more info on it on Google, but couldn't find anyone else having the same problem.  Time for a trip to the <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/">GF</a> dealer I guess.</p>

<p>So, looks like the Spider gets to make the trip without company.  I hate to leave those new wheels just sitting...  If I can't get something reasonably worked out, I guess this means me and the Sugar are going to part ways as I make room for a new 29'er Spider.  Only $1,500 more to go in the bike fund and it's mine.  The only problem is I want two - a new 29'er and XVP Spider in matching blue.  That'd just be awesome.  It's just the $3,500 price tag that's not so cool.</p>

        <title>A weird wake-up...</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/05/a_weird_wake_up/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/05/a_weird_wake_up</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you're asleep, but something from the waking world carries over into the dreamscape you've created for yourself.  I awoke to some rhythmic noise that I couldn't place.  A quick, albeit hazy check out my window across the street showed a couple of cars and lights in the parking lot.  The noise persisted and as I came out of the fog of sleep my mind started trying to make sense of what I was hearing.  I moved out onto my balcony to try and figure it what was going on, tempted to call the cops because it was past midnight, when it dawns on me that I'm listening to someone sobbing in what was as close to an uncontrollable manor as I believe I've heard.  Somewhere in the incomprehensible, near primal weeping, a moment of lucidity: "Someone, please help..."  Two steps later; two steps nearer the phone "... call 911."</p>

<p>As the phone starts ringing on the other end and I return to my balcony perch I see figures start moving across the street to investigate and presumably help.  After telling the operator what I've heard she informs me that help is already on the way and within 30 seconds the first sheriff pulls in.  Within five minutes no fewer than 5 sheriffs's cars, 1 fire truck, and 1 ambulance have been through the parking lot.</p>

<p>And if that wasn't spooky enough for you, a sparse lightening storm is been moving through the scene randomly illuminating it with flash bulb precision.</p>

        <title>Weekend in review</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/04/weekend_in_review/"/>
        <updated>2006-04-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/04/04/weekend_in_review</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twelve hours is a long time to spend in a car driving solo in less than 60 hours, but that's what I did this past weekend.  The race went fairly well, I was in the bottom half of the overall Pro/Expert field, but felt great the whole race.  My goal was to finish and feel like I could have gone out for another lap, and I did.  I was on my Spider, but I felt so much more comfortable in a 29'er rhythm down around 75 - 80 RPM.  With that experience, I'm definitely going to take the 29'er up to the <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/">Dawn 'til Dusk</a> race.  I'll probably switch between the two bikes to see which one feels better and which one has better times</p>

<p>I learned this weekend that if I see something while packing and think to myself "nah, I won't need that", I will.  I had to buy some more <a href="http://www.notubes.com">Stan's</a> because I ripped a tire pre-riding the course Saturday.  I had a new tire, just no Stan's.  Also, when I got through with the ride I noticed one of my linkage bolts had started backing out.  I ended up having to take the crank off to figure out what I just had to pound it back in until it met the threads, then start tightening it.  Ahh... nothing like disassembling your bike the night before a race.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, the race went like I had hoped result wise - finished with energy to spare.  I had no speed though.  I could accelerate for 5 minutes or so, then I'd start backing off 'cause my mind was drifting.  If I thought about it again,  I could start pushing and picking up steam again.  I let heart attack hill get the better of though.  I was worried about having enough in me for that climb that I think I held back when I should have been pushing.  One of the curses of knowing the course too well and not knowing how your body will react to it I guess.</p>

<p>The weekend told me what I needed to know.  I've got a descent enough base to start moving over to the build phase now and start working on speed and power.</p>

<p>As far as placing, I did take 2nd and made my gas money back but I was way off of the first place pace, so there was no contesting that.  Based on previous early season racing though, I'm right where I want to be for a strong end of the year.  I've got the energy to complete the races even though I'm not really competing for wins.  By August though, I'll be a contender - at least at the regional level.  With the early season here in Arizona I'll hopefully be in a place where I can actually do something at the Coyote next year.</p>

<p>This coming weekend's Gallup.  12 hours of punishment.  Fun times :D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can't believe it's almost Friday.  I've had some awesome rides this week, and am hoping for more of the same this weekend in El Paso.  I'm headed over to the <a href="http://www.the-bicycle-company.com/Coyote.html">Coyote Classic</a> in my ol' stomping grounds in the <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/franklin/">Franklin Mountain State Park</a>.  Everything I've heard so far is that the XC course is really knarly now - I can't wait. </p>

<p>I did two days of climbing this week.  Between the two, I got in 5k of climbing including the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-maps/Sunrise+Climb.jpg.html">Sunrise climb</a> (1k vertical feet up in under 2 miles) on my <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/bike-harem/standing-strong-bullit.jpg.html">Bullit</a>.  There was a wind at my back, but just the same it is 41 pounds of bike.  I felt so good the whole climb.  A few sections I was actually surprised to look down and see how low my HR was!  Then, there's the descent.  I swear that the Sunrise descent into Hidden Hills is one of the most fun decents I can think of.  Since it was a weekday, there were only a few hikers on the mile and a half descent.  It qualifies for my newly created Perma-Grin Trail Award.  Sweet, sweet stuff...</p>

<p>Anyhow, my goal for this weekend is to put in a solid performance.  This'll be my first <abbr title="Cross Country">XC</abbr> race of the year, so I don't quite know what to expect out of my body.  Based on last week's race, this should be right at the limit of race-pace riding that starts to get to me, so I should feel strong for the whole race.  With as much racing as I have planned over the next month, I'm shooting to have enough in me for another short loop (8 miles) if not the whole 28 mile course again, but I still want to keep a good pace.  It's a fine balance between giving just enough and leaving it all out on the course and I'm still working on finding that for my body.  In the <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org">NMORS</a> the Expert 19 - 29 category is lumped in with the pros, so this'll be a points race for me, not a podium finish race.</p>

        <title>Wednesday Night Crits, Monday Edition</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night was the Wednesday night crits a few nights early.  I wasn't sure how I was going to feel after the marathon on Friday.  The muscle behind my left knee was as sore as if I had done leg extensions and I'm not exactly sure why.  That muscle doesn't normally bother me after riding.  It'll be something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we had a smaller field than normal and nobody wanted to really push the pace, which was fine by me.  I was third in the first two place prime, won the second prime, and ended up in 4th at the line, one place out of the money.  Another 50 feet or so and I could have got 3rd, but I just ran out of room.</p>

<p>I was kind of surprised by how well I did.  For the second ride in three days, my body felt sluggish and sore until I actually got on a bike and started going.  This weekend is the <a href="http://the-bicycle-company.com/Coyote.html">Coyote</a> in El Paso.  I can't wait to see how I feel in a shorter XC race.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I dropped my <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com">parents</a> off a little over an hour ago for their plane trip back to KC.  They came and hung out at the race on Friday with me and got to see me win.  Definitely a cool bonus.  My mom also added her style to my place helping me get it in a bit better looking shape.</p>

<p>So now I've got to work out who'll go on "vacation" with me next time (read: help me at the next enduro race).</p>

        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/24/well_i_ve_gone_and_done_it/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/24/well_i_ve_gone_and_done_it</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pigs flew, the cows came home, and I understand the ice made it all the way to El Paso.  I <strong>won</strong> my age group.  I put in a decent effort considering, but wasn't 100% happy with it.  That said, they gave out the awards about 35 minutes after I got back in, and 2nd and 3rd place in my category (Men 19 - 29) weren't even back yet!  I'd been back for 5 minutes or so when I saw one of the other guys I was racing against at about the 40% mark on the course where you come back through the parking lot to go out for the long loop.</p>

<p>The reason I wasn't happy is the way I raced the first lap.  I knew one of my biggest enemies would be getting caught up in the initial climb and blasting through it.  I had been turning the Sport/Tech loop in just under 30 minutes, I came through at 25!  I should have slowed down, but I was feeling so good.  I ended up turning my first lap in something like 1:03!  If I could have kept that pace, that'd have been awesome (not too mention to fastest non-pro time).  My times went up from there though.</p>

<p>Of course, there's always the excuses.  This was the hottest ride I've done since last fall when I first moved here.  We topped out at 80 - actually, they shortened the race one lap because of the heat (something I am extremely grateful for).  I had my 1 liter per lap figured out from <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/18/nova_marathon_course_beta_for_mere_morta_1">last week's pre-ride</a> and didn't take into account the 15 or so degree difference between the conditions.  Almost needless to say, I ran out of water on two of the laps.  </p>

<p>The other issue I had was shifting.  On the last two laps, I basically had three gears, my 24-34-44 and my 34 tooth on the cassette.  I blew out my (practically) brand new shifter cable somewhere on the course and couldn't get it to shift at all.  If I really torqued down on the shifter I could sometimes get it to shift a gear or two, but it was random.  I ended up burning a blister into my hand over the shifter trying to get it to shift.  I also rubbed the Sram off of the grip.</p>

<p>Anyhow, showing up and finishing today would have netted me a podium - only three racers showed up for the amateur 19 - 29.  All the fast 20 somethings were in the Open/Pro category, but just the same, I did show up and I did manage a "good enough" ride.  Wow, my first <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/">Norba National</a> race and my first mountain bike win.  What a combination.  I think I'll have a grin on my face for at least a week. :D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just closed <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">MeAndTravis</a> (my old photo site) with a hard redirect to my new <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/">photo</a> site.  I was averaging 270 some unique visitors a day nearly 100% via hotlinking.  It seems some MySpace templater had taken a liking to a few of my photos and was using them as background images.  Not an issue, they're all <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">CC'd</a>, but they hotlinked them via the CSS document.  Anyhow, to all you anonymous MySpacers, sorry, but I like my bandwidth to stay mine.  Hopefully the broken pages will make people change their templates and drive the traffic back down to a reasonable pace.</p>

<p>I feel so tired today.  Last night's crits really took it out of me, and I didn't really go that hard that long.  I'm taking today off the bike, but I think I'm going to go out and play at MMP tomorrow afternoon to get my legs back under me.  I've been fidgety all day...  Remind me next year not to make my first mountain bike race of the year a national race.  What was I thinking?</p>

<p>It's just a tune up race...  It's just a tune up race... It's just a tune up race...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok - I just posted a comment to a post I commented on earlier today...  Sleep, must get sleep.</p>

<p>I'm toast after the crit tonight.  Legs were heavy the whole time, and the fact that they gave the 5 minute warning to start the race as I finished putting my shoes on didn't help.  I was way off the back (as in multiple laps down) at the finish of both the C and B races tonight.  And for the first time in three weeks I didn't even win the first prime.</p>

<p>Well, hopefully the <a href="http://www.juniper-solutions.com/dara/?p=59">ice bath</a> I took earlier will help tomorrow.  Two days to go until the real race season starts though.  I still can't help constantly repeating: "70 miles, 70 freaking miles.  Am I crazy?"</p>

<p>Don't answer that...</p>

        <title>Reality Check</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/18/reality_check/"/>
        <updated>2006-03-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/18/reality_check</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, I got back in from my ride this afternoon feeling great, but every now and then you need a reality check.  No matter how much energy and time and money and heart you put into racing bikes it is, after all, just racing bikes.</p>

<p>I got back this afternoon to an email from a friend saying a mutual friend's son had been involved in a car accident last night around 2 AM and was currently in the hospital with hope slim.  He was loosing blood faster than they could put it in, had two broken femurs, a broken back, massive internal injuries and couldn't breath on his own.  Within a few hours he had sent another saying that he had passed away shortly after 3 this afternoon.</p>

<p>It's not that I knew him that well... I haven't seen or talked to him or his family for several years now.  But I share a bond with them that those who don't can't fully appreciate.  When something like this happens, it makes you ask yourself why you're doing what you're doing with your life and if it's the right thing.  This last month has been all about two things: work and riding.  I enjoy my work and like to think that even only if in an abstract way it does make a difference.  More importantly, it funds the riding.</p>

<p>So why do I ride?  It's hard to put into words without sounding cliche.  There's something about knowing that you've taken your body to within inches of its limits, and then pushed a little bit more.  There's something in the reaction people give you when you tell them that you race your bike distances that are further than most of them drive in a week or for lengths of time that they can't imagine doing the same thing for, much less something as physically demanding as riding a bike while not realizing that it's not the physical that's the hard part.  It's for that split second as you feel your wheels leave the ground as you catch air.  The new found energy you get when someone comes into view in front of you and you realize you can catch them.  In essense, it's about being alive, and having every fiber in your body realize it.</p>

<p>I wear a <a href="http://www.roadid.com/fixx_learnmore.asp?back=/id.asp">Road Id</a> when I'm riding.  On the back of it is a quote I had them put on it: "<em>Ride for those who can't</em>".  It was a tribute to a friend and fellow cyclist who at the time had just finished undergoing chemo.  His body basically being destroyed to save itself, he went through a long period that he couldn't ride.  When you get a reality check like this one today, that saying means that much more... both in it's obvious meaning and it's allegorical.</p>

        <title>Nova Marathon course beta... for mere mortals take two</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went out today to get in some more riding on the <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova</a> course.  Put in three laps and was really pleased with my times.  They were all within a minute and thirty seconds of each other with my last lap only 9 seconds slower than my first.  That's definitely where I want to be on Friday.  It dawned on me when I was completing my last lap that this is the most singletrack I've ridden in one day since the <a href="http://www.heartlandrace.com/spoke.htm">Spoke Pony</a> exactly one year ago today.  I guess history does repeat itself...</p>

<p>I tried <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/17/tuesday_ride_aamp_wednesday_night_crit_r#comments">Dave's eGel suggestion</a> and it worked great.  The first two laps I had three eGels and topped it off with water.  A lot easier to swallow, but still a little thick.  The third lap I did two gels and the rest water.  That worked great.  As an added bonus you don't have that last little bit of gel stuck in the flask because it's too thick to come out.</p>

<p>As for the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/admin/b2browse.php?tab=posts&amp;blog=2&amp;p=723&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">wheels</a>, they're awesome.  Based on what I know of <a href="http://www.speeddream.com/">Dave's wheels</a> I expected nothing less. Still, being on them for 40 some miles is a good "test" run for them.  I hooked 'em up with WTB's 29'er <a href="http://www.wtb.com/products/tires_29er.html">Nano Rapter</a>.  Light weight (for 29'er tires) and they roll extremely fast.  I know, I know, Stan doesn't recommend WTB tires with his tubeless setup, but I've never once had a problem with them other than one ripped tire.  A quarter inch gash in the tread is going to be a flat any way you shake it.  I need to give Dave a call, I saw him on the trail today and didn't do a "stop-and-chat".  Don't want him to think I was being rude.  I was on my third lap and really in the zone so I'm sure he'll understand.</p>

<div class="imgRight"><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/5207-2/nova-marathon-preride"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/5210-2/nova-marathon-preride" /><br />
Click for larger image</a></div><p>And now, for what I'm sure you've all been waiting for, the course profile.  <a href="http://www.motionbased.com">MotionBased</a> cheated me out of a couple of miles for some reason.  My GPS read just under 42 (each lap was 13.9x), but when I loaded it onto the computer it's showing 38 miles as the distance.  Also, the South Ridge has some sort of vortex thing going on.  My signal went out as soon as I passed the South Ridge sign every time - that's the reason for the straight drop toward the end of each lap.</p>

<p>So the course starts off with a steady middle ring (for me) climb.  It doesn't seem like you do that much climbing at the start until you look at an elevation profile.  There's enough g-drops in it to keep it from seeming like a real climb though.  Once you top out and turn to go around the little hill/mountain you see in the middle of the course the trail starts getting ripping fast. There's a few 90 degree turns with quick ups that will get you if you're not ready for them though.  That's the story of this course, defensive shifting.  As you follow this around the mountain it stays extremely fast.  It'll be the low end of the cassette and the middle ring or big ring nearly the whole way.  </p>

<p>This part of the course isn't technical in the normal sense, but it's ripping fast.  The faster you go the more important it is to hit the right lines.  I noticed my second lap through this part yesterday was much faster than the first because I had a feel for the lines.</p>

<p>Once around the mountain you get to the only really technical part of the course, and it's on the worse climb of the course.  You start up the middle of the hill you just went around and work your way straight up.  No steps or anything like that to contend with, just some tight corners.  On a scale of technicality 1 - 5, I would rank somewhere around 2 - 2.5.  Just enough to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>After you top out with a few switchbacks, it's down...  straight down.  This section of the course is one of the things I really don't like.  As a trail builder, it's awful.  It's nearly all fall-line trail.  With the grade they had to work with, they could have got several hundred more yards of trail out of this downhill section and still kept if steep and technical.  Instead, they just go straight down.</p>

<p>Off of my soap box though, you get into some back and forth and up and down until you go through the Tunnel.  At this point, you've covered the most technical part of the "Technical" loop.  From here you get some more ripping fast, flowy trail.  At the end of this you go through a wash and pull a quick right and here again if you're not in the right gear you're going to get bogged down - or at a minimum expend more energy than it's worth.  </p>

<p>For an endurance race, this is the one thing that makes this course hard: there are a lot of transitions where you go from big ring to middle ring with no warning other than foreknowledge of the course.  A couple of laps and you should have it dialed in, but 40% of the race is over by then and you'll have spent a lot more energy than you needed to.</p>

<p>After this little climb, you start back down to the parking lot.  Nothing super technical here, but there are a few really rocky sections.  The first time through I felt confident, but the second time around I aced this section.  Again, just knowing the course a bit better helped through it.</p>

<p>Once you make it back to the parking lot you've covered right at 6 miles.  As this section covers the two longest sustained climbs, making it back to the parking lot is a good time check.  Based on yesterday's ride, I'm shooting for sub-35 minute checks here.  Sub-30 would be booking through this section and might actually mean I'm putting too much effort into the second climb.</p>

<p>From here you head out on the long loop.  This takes up the next 8 miles of the course.  The transitions on this section are much easier to get by sight.  There are a few short, and odd climbs that'll cause a HR spike if you're not careful, but nothing sneaks up on you as quickly with one exception.  For some reason the climb up onto the South Ridge (marked with a sign at the top) always gets me.  It's a little rocky and not very steep, but something about it sucks the energy out of me.  If it's a hot day Friday, this 200 yards or so will be an energy drainer.</p>

<p>Thankfully, when you make it to the top you've got a nice gradual downhill to recover on before you drop off of the South Ridge.  This is the rocky section Dave talked as a nice 29'er spot.  This just beats you up, but it's not very long.  From there you get into some flowy gradual up and downs and back and forths the rest of the way out.  On this section I'm shooting to keep every lap in the 40 minute range.  </p>

<p>Assuming 1:15 - 1:20 minute laps are my par, that'll put me at 6.5 - 7 hours of riding.  Obviously, I'm shooting for something a lot closer to 6 hours as that was last year's winning time in the amateur age class I'll be racing in.  As I've said before, this is a tune-up race though, so winning it isn't the goal.  I would like a strong personal finish though.</p>

<p>For me at this race, a <em>strong personal finish</em> means a few things:</p>
<ul><li>Keeping consistent lap times</li>
<li>Keeping the right mental focus during the entire race</li>
<li>Focus on proper hydration/nutrition as a prep for the 12 hour races coming up</li>
<li>Finishing with enough energy left over for another lap</li></ul>

<p>Since this is the start of 4 weeks of races, I don't want to leave everything out there on the course like I would if this was a race I was targeting.  This last goal should be easy as I normally feel I could ride some more after I get through with a race.  That's always been an issue with me and shorter XC races, but that's another post.</p>

<p>The mental focus is the one I need to work on.  I have a tendency to see riders going and want to go - again an issue with XC races where loosing someone in the first five minutes might mean you never see them again.  70 miles is a long race and I need to keep it in focus that letting someone go 15 minutes into the race is fine.  If they're strong enough to keep that pace the whole race then they would have beat me anyway.  If they're not, I'll catch them a few hours in.</p>

<p>So, there you go - a preride of the course and how I'm planning on attacking it.  Speaking of attacking it, I'm going to head out and ride the course some more.  Man it's nice to be 10 minutes by car or 20 minutes by bike from the opener of the national series :-)  If my GPS cooperates with me today, I'll post a profile of the course this afternoon.</p>

        <title>Tuesday Ride &amp; Wednesday Night Crit Recap</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/17/tuesday_ride_aamp_wednesday_night_crit_r/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/17/tuesday_ride_aamp_wednesday_night_crit_r</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it's a few days after the fact, but at least I am updating.  This week's crits still hurt, but not as bad as the first week.  That said, I ended both of them a lap down.  I did what I set out to accomplish in the C race, rode near the front for as long as I could helping make sure the pace didn't get out of control.  I won the first prime again this week - a big back of Oreo's - but was dropped two laps after that.  I've got to work on dosing those early efforts.</p>

<p>I decided to do the B race with no real illusions of doing much more than hang on.  After the first break I covered back up to the front and blew up.  I sat up and just got into a nice cadence for about 5 minutes while they worked on lapping me.  Once I got back in to the group a lap down I hung on til the end.  Based on how I finished the B race, I'm thinking about doing the D race as a warm up for the C - I think 15 minutes at a relatively high pace would get my heart going enough so that about 10 minutes into the C race I'd be in good shape.</p>

<p>What hurt me - and kept me off of the lead lap - was my Tuesday ride.  I did the McDowell mountain loop around through Scottsdale solo in TT mode.  More than anything I wanted to go out and do a good solid 2+ hours at a slightly uncomfortable pace to see how my body would handle it.  </p>

<p>I also wanted to experiment with fueling.  I found an <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">eGel</a> every 30 minutes did it's job great.  Works out to a nice 300 calories an hour.  It's one thing to eat on the road though, and another thing entirely to eat off road.  It's going to be challenging to get that much gel down every lap at Nova next week, but this'll be a good experiment for me.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I truly feel sorry for you.  That your life is so utterly void of meaning, so unrewarding, so pathetic that you feel the need to pass me by no more than 6" at 45 miles an hour, wait for my reaction, then vehemently motion that I should be riding "over there" (as can only be assumed by your hand gesture pointing to the right) makes me pity you.  Do you really lack control over anything in your life that you felt the need to act out on the one thing you could "control"?  Is it the dead-end job that gives you no satisifaction?  Or is it the P.O.S car you were driving while going through Scottsdale and seeing all the "nice" cars?  Or you're just a morally backrupt individual who attempts to run over everything and everyone that gets in <em>your way</em> and then gets pissed off at them for being in <em>your way</em> in the first place?</p>

<p>I would ask you: where would you have had me ride?  There was 3" of pavement to the right of the white line.  Perhaps I should have been in the dirt?  I know, I know, my little "toy" doesn't belong on the street.  "Streets are for cars, silly" right?  When my bike cost more than your car I'll ride it down the middle of the lane if it pleases me, but the last thing I'll do is ride it in the dirt so you don't have to - gasp - slow down.  Your accelerator and a green light saved you from a verbal tongue lashing the likes of which you have never - I repeat, <strong>never</strong> - had to endure.  Another 100 yards with a red light and we would have seen if you felt as confident when we were on equal terms - you, backed up in traffic and me, agile and easily mobile on my bike.</p>

<p>I feel nothing but pity for you, but I still would have bashed in your door if that damned red light would have cooperated.  Oh, and for the record, I rode the rest of Pima in the middle of the lane to insure no one was given the tempation to pass without giving me plenty of room so your little "control" episode... it backfired.</p>

        <title>Sunday recovery ride report</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/12/sunday_recovery_ride_report/"/>
        <updated>2006-03-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/12/sunday_recovery_ride_report</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="imgRight" src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/2006-03-12-ride-summary.png" />Look at those temperatures!  This is Phoenix people - it's not supposed to be that cold at noon in March!</p>

<p>I was looking over my stats on <a href="http://www.motionbased.com/">MotionBased.com</a> and I realized that today's ride was the first ride I put in over 50 miles all year!  I'm not exactly sure how I managed making it this far into the year without any substantial mileage, but I guess with the whole being sick thing I just hadn't put in any real amount of time on the bike.  This was also the first time I've been on a bike for more than 3 hours all year.  I've had a couple of rides pushing the 3 hour mark, but nothing's broken through it until today.  Even with the lack of riding up til today, I felt good the whole ride.</p>

<p>I started out with the plan of just doing a simple recovery ride.  I woke up with my legs still stiff from Thursday's weight session.  That plan worked well, I kept my average heart rate right at 130 all the way down the Beeline, but then I cut through the indian reservation.  As I rode through and noticed the lack of fences... anywhere, I kept thinking to myself, ok, so when are the dogs going to start chasing me.  I had made it all the way across Indian School with just another mile or two to go and right as I started to think I was home free here they come.  Actually, it's amazing how easy sprinting is when you're doing it from a 130 <abbr title="beats per minute">bpm</abbr> heart rate as opposed to 170 or 180.  Just as I got those 4 dogs off of my tail here's two pit bulls looking for something to chase.  They didn't last as long as the other and within a couple hundred yards were gone.  I decided at that point that I was <abbr title="time trial">TT</abbr>'ing it the rest of the way out of the reservation.</p>

<p>Those two spikes coupled with my vain attempt to catch a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/12/to_the_anonymous_asshole_in_the_sedan_yo">rouge motorist</a> were the only times my HR spiked during the first few hours.  The plan was to come up Via Linda to 136th St and then hit Shea and back home, but the hills beckoned.  I ended up doing the 136th and the Via Linda/Hidden Hills climbs three times each.  By the time I got home I had put in nearly 12 miles of climbing, and felt great when I got home.</p>

<p>With some company, today's ride would have made a great lower half of a figure eight.  You could start out with the easy part through the valley, come back up and do some hill repeats, swing back through Fountain Hills and restock supplies, then take off on the loop around the mountain and finish off with another set of repeats.  That would put the 9 mile climb somewhere in around mile 70 and would put the total mileage somewhere in the region of 110 miles with about 30 miles of climbing!  I felt like I could have done that today since I was just out dinking around, but I would have gone stir crazy on that climb out of Rio Verde without someone to talk to or something to occupy my thoughts other than counting utility poles.  That climb is mentally tough enough when it happens in the first 30 minutes of a ride, I can't imagine doing it 4 hours in.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/11/when_it_rains_it_pours</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok - so I move to Phoenix two weeks after a drought starts.  Rain is a vague memory by this time.  But today...  Today, I get new wheels for my bike and what does it do?  Nothing... well, except for rain <strong>all</strong> day!  If I'm lucky I'll get in some riding tomorrow on the road, but my new wheels will get stuck in the stable for a bit while the ground dries up.  This should actually be great for <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova</a> in a few weeks, but still.  Couldn't it have waited until tomorrow or Monday?</p>

<p>Now that I have the wheels, I have the actual weight on them: 737g for the front and 889g for the rear for a grand total of 1626 grams.  For those keeping track, that's 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of a pound lighter than Bontrager's Race Disc and even more than their Race Lite Disc (don't ask me, Race <em>Lite</em> wheels are heavier).  Throw in that I'm cutting weight for the rim tape and strip in the Bontragers and I start getting really close to dropping a pound in rotational weight.  I really can't wait to get on some dirt and try these babies out.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last two new-to-me movies I've watched have been unbelievable, but also extremely depressing.  I finally watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/">The Constant Gardener</a>.  Wow.  The movie was excellent.  For the first 45 minutes I kept thinking "ok, so I already know this from the previews, how are they going to fill another hour or more?" then it sucks you in.  The last 1:15 just flew by.</p>

<p>When the novel a movie is based on is banned in the country it depicts, it tells you it must have hit too close to home.  One of my favorite lines of the movie was along the lines "This is all guilt" in describing aid to Africa.  Definitely add this to your must see list of movies.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/10/wheels_are_ready_tomorrow</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So when I talked to <a href="http://www.speeddream.com/">Dave</a> earlier in the week about <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/07/new_wheels_are_on_the_way">my new wheels</a> he said to give him a call Friday or so to make sure everything got in and that he'd be able to build up the wheels without any delay.  I told him I wasn't in a big hurry, but that I was going to be racing on them in a few weeks at <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova</a> to which he said "ok, I'll mark them as ASAP and should have them by for you by next Tuesday."  So I call him up today to check in on them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I've got everything together for them and I'm going to build them tonight.  I'll drop them off at the shop tomorrow morning for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah!  Sweet!  These are hand built, super light, super tough wheels (from everything I've read about them) and they're a few hundred bucks cheaper than CrossMax's from Mavic.  And the turn around is literally 3 days to get them!  Dave's my hero!</p>

<p>The only problem is that there's a 90% chance of rain tomorrow, so I probably won't get to ride them.  No bother though, that'll give me a chance to get them setup and I want to run new shifter cables on my Sugar anyway.  As soon as I get a chance to take 'em for a spin, I'll post up my initial thoughts.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you see me in the next day or so and it looks like I'm walking funny, I am.  The reason: it's called a gym and they would be better called houses of self-inflicted torture and torturing devices.</p>

        <title>Work those legs</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/09/work_those_legs</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ouch.  It's been over two and a half years since I've done a major leg work out.  Again, ouch!  I forgot what it's like to feel weird walking around when it wasn't caused by alcohol.  So my brute force strength in my legs is not where it used to be.  The last I remember I was able to do an incline leg press of nearly 300 lbs.; tonight it was at 200 lbs.</p>

<p>So you might be asking yourself, leg workouts on weights two weeks before a month of racing?  I wasn't going to, but I've decided to treat all of these upcoming races as tune-up races.  Don't get me wrong, I want some strong finishes, but I'm going to treat them like most people would treat January or February races: I'm going to work on weights and strength training right through them.  I'm trying to mix it up with the weights plus the weekly crits and near weekly mountain bike racing in April to build a really strong base.  Then in May and June I'll start spending more time on the bike and start phasing out the weight workouts.  July will start off with two more tune up races and then some maintenance and build-up to the Norba Marathon National Championship in the first weekend in August.</p>

<p>That actually puts me in a perfect position to be nice and recovered and peaking again for the <a href="http://www.roadapplerally.com/">Road Apple Rally</a> - the NMORS Finals - and the <a href="http://www.grannygear.com/Races/Moab/index.shtml">24 Hours of Moab</a>.  I was kind of hoping I could pull off the <a href="http://www.grannygear.com/Races/Landahl/index.shtml">24 Hours of Landahl</a> as that was the course I did <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/03/20/what_i_learned_from_riding_my_bike_for_6">my first timed endurance race</a>, but that might be pushing it if I really focus on the national championship.</p>

<p>Man, I'm thinking about races in August and October in the first week of March!  I must either be really crazy or have racing in my blood. :>></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just helping do my part to get <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/">Bill Napoli</a> the recognition he deserves.  Why you might ask?  Because <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/">Bill Napoli</a> has given us a new euphemism.</p>

<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june06/abortion_3-03.html">Quote from PBS</a><em><br />
<a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/">BILL NAPOLI</a>: A real-life description to me would be a rape victim, brutally raped, savaged. The girl was a virgin. She was religious. She planned on saving her virginity until she was married. She was brutalized and raped, sodomized as bad as you can possibly make it, and is impregnated. I mean, that girl could be so messed up, physically and psychologically, that carrying that child could very well threaten her life.</em></em></p></blockquote>

<p>What a winner.  See what happens when you let the whites into the Dakotas? :crazy:</p>

<p>My questions, if she's raped and was "religious" but wasn't planning on saving herself for marriage, should an abortion be an option in that case?  Is that "saving her virginity until she married" the key thing?  What about if she's not religious but was planning on "saving her[self]"?  Are they both required in tandem, or is one or the other enough?  And if she's not a virgin?  Is virginity required?  What about sodomy, is it required?  That seems to be the threshold thing here as that's when it becomes "as bad as you can possibly make it".  So <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/">Napoli</a>, the comments are open, feel free to clarify yourself.</p>

        <title>First race of the year</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made it to my first race of the year.  Man am I out of race shape.  I haven't loaded the data from the ride into the computer to take a look at it yet, but everytime I looked down my heart rate was in the 190s.  20 minutes of redline effort!  Ouch...</p>

<p>So I felt half-way decent in the race - it's always hard racing in events like this when there's teams on the course and your riding solo.  That and all of the other solos that are out there vying for position.  I raced smart, there were only two times I was on the front.  I took the first prime (pronounced "preem" for my none cycling readers) beating another guy out in the sprint by a half bike length.  Felt pretty confident after that - if I could have stayed at the front and it was a sprint to the line for the finish I believe I could have held my own.</p>

<p>The other time I was trying to control the pace.  We had one of the team guys off of the front with 2 or 3 of his teammates near the front to cover any attacks.  We started reeling him in pretty quickly, so I moved to the front and tried to slow the pace down.  I wanted to leave him hanging for as long as I could to try and take him out of the race.  This worked for a half lap until someone decided to try and bridge the gap.  Word to the wise, if a team member's guy is out front and you try to bridge the gap, prepare for company.  If a handful of them are sitting near the front, prepare for a bus load.  Needless to say, once the rider went off the front, the pace picked up and we closed the gap to the break away in a less than a 1/4 lap.</p>

<p>On the final lap I was in excellent position - about 5th.  At turn 1, one of the riders broke off and it was on.  The pace picked up and within a 100 yards my heart rate had spiked from it's already redline point and I popped.  I sat up on the back straight away and just soft pedaled across the line.  With only five mintues to recover before the B race, I decided to stay and watch instead of participate.</p>

<p>Like I said, I felt good - short of the constant redline.  Next week I'll probably try the B race too and just stick in the pack for as long as I can.  I should have raced it tonight to get another 30 minutes of race pace riding in.</p>

<p>On another semi-related note, the races the end of the month are rescheduled from Wednesday for various reasons.  The final race in March will be on Monday, which happens to be the same Monday my parents are in town so they'll get to watch me race two races while they're here.  I have no plans to win the race on Friday, but I could possibly pull something off on Monday at the crit race.  My parents will probably only see me race a few times this year, so it'd be cool if they could see me win one.</p>

        <title>Training recap</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/07/training_recap/"/>
        <updated>2006-03-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/07/training_recap</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, I meant to do this on Sunday, but just never got around to it.  There's just too many things to do these days and time is just going to get shorter and shorter in supply as this month goes on.</p>

<p>Sunday I thought about doing the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man">Sunrise Climb</a>, but decided against it and hit the road.  I've heard a lot about the Hidden Hills climb at the end of Via Linda, so after doing some of the climbs around Fountain Hills on the way over there, I hit it up.  Frankly, I was a little disappointed.  It did kick up to around 6% in a few places, but compared to how I do my hill play, that's just a nice warm up.</p>

<p>On the way back out though, I found a climb I like.  As you're headed east on Shea, you've probably notice the houses that seem to be half way up the mountain at N. 136th St - yup, they really are.  From Via Linda you cover over 550 vertical feet in just over a mile!  There's a few hundred yards up to the gated community's gate at around 5%; after the gate it kicks up to 7% and doesn't relent.  You climb between 7% - 8% for all but the last 300 - 400 yards which kicks up to over 16%.  My computer showed it as 18.2%!  I know by the time I got to the top I was wiped.  It was literally all I could do to turn the pedals overs.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night I'm going to head down to the Tempe/Phoenix border and check out the <a href="http://www.azcycling.com/06cal/FLYERS/PCC%20Crit%20Series.htm">Phoenix Consumers Crit Series</a>.  It's been over a year and a half since I've raced on the road.  The last stage race I was in I <abbr title="Did Not Finish">DNF</abbr>'d and before that by a few weeks was a short crit that I won.  It'll be interesting to see how the Phoenix Cat 4/5 racers are compared to Kansas City and El Paso.  With any luck, I'll be able to make enough of these over the next month to get in the races I need for my upgrade to Cat 4.  I hate racing as an Expert off-road, but a Cat 5 (beginner basically) on-road.</p>

<p>Just two and a half weeks left to the National Marathon opener!</p>

        <title>New wheels are on the way</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's nothing like having the wind at your back on a climb.  Except, being the optimistic pessimist that I am, I kept thinking how much the ride back into Fountain Hills was going to suck.  It did.  I averaged over 20 mph on the ride out - and that included a crosswind climb of the McDowell Mtn. Park road - and was somewhere just over 17 on the way back.  </p>

<p>One of the cool things about the ride out was being able to hear my tires humming on the pavement.  You could tell and audible difference between riding on paint and asphalt.  On the ride back, I could barely hear myself think.</p>

<p>But on to the title - I called up Dave at <a href="http://www.speeddream.com/">SpeedDream</a> wheels today and we're all set for my secret weapon come race day.  So it's just between us.  Cool? ;)</p>

<p>For the cyclist readers: I'm running an old style American Classic front hub with a Hope Pro 2 on the rear, <a href="http://www.notubes.com/home.php">Stan's</a> <a href="http://www.notubes.com/product_info.php/cPath/487_489/products_id/309">ZTR 355's</a> with the spoke combination that Dave recommended, 14/15 on the drive side and an ovalized 15 on the none-drive side.  Should be lightweight and durable.  If the <a href="http://www.mtbr.com/reviews/Wheelset/product_23649.shtml">nearly 100 reviews</a> are any indication, these wheels should be bomb proof.</p>

        <title>Pre-ride report from McDowell Mountain Park</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/04/pre_ride_report_from_mcdowell_mountain_p/"/>
        <updated>2006-03-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/04/pre_ride_report_from_mcdowell_mountain_p</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weekends in a row and two pre-rides in a row.  Man, it must almost be race season.  :D</p>

<p>Today's pre-ride wasn't as big of a deal as <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/02/26/pre_ride_report_from_dawn_til_dusk_in_ga">last week's</a>.  No four hour drive was involved, I actually rode my bike to the trail head.  How cool is that?  I can ride my bike four miles to the trail head of the series opener for the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/">Norba National Mountain Bike Series</a> marathon race.</p>

<p>The ride was uneventful.  I've ridden this course before, though I did some new singletrack as I don't normally ride so I could see the <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139#11_tbb_maps">course</a> the way they've got mapped out.  I was on my <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/bike-harem/standing-strong-bullit.jpg.html">big bike</a> (which needs a name, by the way), so my time was slower than it will be on race day.  I was definitely pleased with the time though.  I had guessed it within 2 minutes.  </p>

<p>I felt good the whole ride, and had a ton of stuff on my back since I was prepped for about 3 hours of riding.  If I would have had some water stashed away at the trailhead, I would have gone out for another lap to see how it felt.  I think I'll be ready for this race.  I'm still not counting on being in contention, but I feel I can put in a good effort.</p>

<p>I normally ride with just plain water and use my own custom blend of <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">e-Fuel</a> with some other goodies as a recovery drink right after I get off of the bike.  The last two rides I've been on I've been trying something new, using <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">e-Fuel</a> the way it was meant to be used - during the ride.  Today I took a water bottle filled with it in addition to my Camelbak.  Given how my preparation for the <strike>race</strike>ride wasn't the best yesterday, I was impressed that I was able to ride today for almost three hours any complaints from my body.  I'll probably try to work that in to my race routine.  Maybe I'll do one with water, one lap with <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">e-Fuel</a> and switch off.</p>

<p>I had my <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner301/">Forerunner</a> with me.  Once I get the ride info into the computer, I'll post a profile of the course for any out-of-towners that are curious as to what it looks like.</p>

        <title>The times, they are a changin'...</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/02/the_times_they_are_a_changin/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/03/02/the_times_they_are_a_changin</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can tell just by my eating habits.  It's been getting warmer, and the foods of winter - heavier, greasier, etc. - just dont' seem as appealing.  Give me a sandwich and I feel better all day.  This might take some getting used to, because this change normally comes a month or so later for me.  I guess it's just the fact that it gets warmer here earlier in the year.</p>

<p>So for the last week I've had the flyer from the <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova Desert Classic</a> sitting in front of me on my desk.  I've picked it up and looked it over a few times, and had come to the conclusion I wasn't going to race.  I know my current shape, and it's nowhere near racing Expert 25-29 at a national level race.  Even though this isn't a <abbr title="NORBA Championship Bike Series">NCBS</abbr> race this year, it'll attract a lot of top level people from around the region.  That and it's just a few weeks before Gallup.  A 3 day stage race followed by a brutal XC race the next week and then a 12 hour race makes me hurt to think about.</p>

<p>But today the fact that the Marathon race is part of the Norba series finally hit me.  So I started doing some looking into it.  In the Norba Marathon series, you have the Open/Pro division in men, then 19 - 29, 30 - 39, etc., through a 50+ division.  I've only witnessed one Norba marathon race and it was a 6 hour race without many racers.  With my curiousity peaked, I looked at the results from last year...</p>

<p>There wasn't a single racer in the 19 - 29 age group that raced more than one race the whole 7 race season!  First place was a 6 way tie among the 6 different first place winner of the season.  There was one race that no one even showed up for my age group.  And the guy who won the last race - against only one other racer I might add - won the title by default (tie breakers are determined by who finished higher in the latest race).  A check of the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/guide/marathon.shtml">calendar</a> this year shows that all the races are in the western half of the country with San Francisco (Sonoma on the 14th of July) being the furthest away.</p>

<p>I'm really thinking about giving it a shot this year.  I'm in no shape to win the Nova race right now, nor will I be in 3 weeks, but I could finish it.  If I can finish and keep myself healthy, the other races aren't that far away to go race in them.  It's not like I'd have to go out to West Virgina like I would have had to last year.  Even if I could just get the ones that are an easy day's drive away, that's still three races.  And the finals at Brian Head, Utah are in August.  That's a month that's normally a really good racing month for me as I've just come off of the Tour cloud where I spend a three weeks consumed with racing and bikes.</p>

<p>So now I've got a lot to think about.  To race at the national level, or not to?</p>

        <title>Pre-Ride Report from Dawn 'til Dusk in Gallup</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/02/26/pre_ride_report_from_dawn_til_dusk_in_ga/"/>
        <updated>2006-02-26T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/02/26/pre_ride_report_from_dawn_til_dusk_in_ga</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm beat.  I drove up to <a href="http://www.gallupnm.org/">Gallup, NM</a> yesterday to pre-ride the race course for the upcoming <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/default.asp">Dawn 'til Dusk 12 Hour</a> race.  The course was a blast - even with the few leg burners that are in it.</p>

<p>According to the guys at the Scoreboard (505-722-6077, no website), the trail is pretty new.  At last year's race, they had just finished it so the racers were basically burning it in.  There's not many mountain bikers in Gallup, so the trail doesn't see a lot of traffic.  While most of it was pretty well burned in, there were sections that still had that new trail bumpy feeling to it.  A squishy will definitely save your back if you're riding solo or duo.</p>

<p>The course starts off with a climb, nothing crazy but it lets you know that's its there.  As you finish up the first mile, you drop into this really fun slick-rock section that flows great.  It's just buttering you up for the worse part of the course.  According to my <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner301/">Forerunner</a>, there's a 25% climb on the course right after the slick-rock.  You go from flowy, full toothed grin to a nice halt as you grind out the climb.  It's only a couple of hundred yards, but both times I did the course my heart rate spiked and I felt like passing out would be a blessing - wouldn't have to keep riding.  I can't imagine how that climb would feel at hour 10.  Of course, by then I'd be little ringing it instead of middle ring, so that'd probably help.</p>

<p>After that "<em>treat</em>", you have a little more climbing before you're onto what I consider the start of the second mesa.  The trail gets into this groovy flow where you're big-ringing it and it feel like you're hauling.  My max speed was only 18.6 mph, but it felt like I was doing 25 through parts of it.  There's a couple of corners through this section that are sandy.  I figure as the race wears on, these are going to get messy.  Something to think about.  If you're not 100% confident handling skinnies, you might want to consider a 2.1+ for some extra traction through those corners.</p>

<p>The end of this flowy section, about 3.5 miles into the course, you have a really abrupt change.  It goes from super fast into a quick 90 degree turn and climb through some rocks.  Nothing technical, but if you're not expecting it, you'll be in the wrong gear for that climb.  After this, the trail calms down.  There's still some fast sections - all of it's middle ring with some big ring sections.  You go through a really cool bunch of rocks a mile or so from the turn around point - lots of sand through this section though, another spot that'll bog down once the race gets going.</p>

<p>Once you make it to the turn around, you fly with a bunch of up and down with a really good flow.  A strong rider will be in the big ring most of this section, and a 29'er would fly.  About a mile from the turn around you go through a nearly 180 degree turn 10' from the edge of one of the mesas.  My first trip around I checked the edge - 50' straight down.  An awesome view, but you probably won't be paying too much attention to it during the race.  From the turn around you go along the edge of the mesa for few hundred yards, then drop down off of it.  There's a few sections with blind corners that feel weird the first time you do them, but once you know what's coming you can bomb through this section.  That said, there's a few places you want to make sure you make the corner.  In one corner there's a nice big rock waiting to impale you and another has an old tree that looks like it would love to grab you.</p>

<p>You'll cross back over into the 3rd mesa - or the expert loop - and you're greated by a crazy descent.  No drops or anything DH-oriented like that, but on an XC bike with a super aggressive position it felt like I was out over the top of the wheel on a few sections.  Again, the first time through it was the worse, the second time I was sliding through the corners like a wannabe pro.  From there, you have a little more climbing back up to the last cross over where you start the final descent back into the starting line.  At the last cross over, you have four miles to go.  At this point, you're coming off of the highest point of the course.  </p>

<p>The descent starts off fun and fast enough, then you drop through a crack and before you know it, you're at a turn that if you miss you've got a 10' drop onto the next rock face.  This characterizes the rest of the course.  There's nothing technical about it, but some of the exposures make a simple switchback feel like you're on a 2x4 skinny.  There's a couple of places where you're looking at trail that's 100' vertically below you, and you get there in a few hundred yards with a couple of switchbacks.  Again, it's nothing crazy steep, but you would do good to preride this section at least once before the race.</p>

<p>I ended up doing two laps - one Saturday afternoon and again Sunday morning.  The Saturday one included several breaks that were the result of not knowing when to push on the course and the 4 hour drive up.  Both laps had ride times sub 1:30.  Today's lap I felt like I was keeping a pace that I could have kept for several laps in a row.  Once you get the feel of the course, you should be able to fly around it.</p>

<p>Again, I'd recommend a dual-suspension for the course if you're doing duo or solo unless you're just into pain.  The course is still raw in some areas, so a hardtail or rigid will really beat you up.  Of course, if that's what you're used to.</p>

<p>Last year's winner put in 9 laps with the second place rider putting in eight on a SS.  Personally, I would think a SS would really suck on this course.  I was constantly switching from my big ring to my middle ring for descending or climbing respectively.  With a SS I think you'd end up with a gear for the climbing or a gear for the descending.  Of course, an XC race isn't won going down the hill.</p>

<p>Last year's race also was "almost spitting snow" with a crazy wind.  I was told to expect the wind again this year, but we should be a no-go on the snow.  According to the local bike shop, they should have snow on the ground right now.  Thankfully, though it was cold - 28 degrees when I started at 9 - there was no snow to be found.</p>

<p>As for the 29'er verses 26": I'm may take both, but I'm leaning toward the 26".  I think the second mesa - the middle of the course - is perfectly suited to a 29'er.  Those first few climbs, though they're not long, do get steep and would suck the wind out of you.  And on the final few miles there's a few switchbacks that would be pretty tight on a long wheelbased 29'er.</p>

<p>As for pre-riding, as with any race course I would definitely recommend it.  If you can't make it to Gallup to pre-ride before the race, I would try to make it in early enough on Friday afternoon that you at least do the climb up to the first cross-over, and instead of going straight, hang a right and come down the final descent.  That's about a 6 mile loop that'll show you the worse climb and the worse descent.  Depending on how strong you're climbing, plan on 30 - 45 minutes for that part of the course.</p>

<p>And finally, here's a profile of the course as my GPS rendered it:<br />

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... or I've subconsciously slipped into spring training mode.  Today was the first time that I can remember where I was barely able to stomach a half a <a href="http://www.redbaron.com/publish/products_classic.htm">pizza</a>.  I normally can eat 3/4ths no problem, and most days I can eat a whole one.  Today at lunch the second piece was agony to finish - all the grease, seemed so heavy, just felt bad going down.</p>

<p>I guess this is my body's way of telling me to shape up.  I've actually been in bed at a decent hour every night and the latest I've woken up is 7:30 and today I woke up at a quarter to 7 beating my alarm up.  I guess now that my body's back in a circadian rhythm, it wants good food.</p>

<p>Here comes Gallup tomorrow!</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>For my non-cyclist readers, spring training mode for me generally involves eating much better and finally getting out of the bad habits I got into over the winter: eating poorly, drinking more than I should, not riding as much as I should, etc.  It's normally accompanied by a drop in body fat into the sub-10 range along with a drop in weight.</fieldset>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm not posting nearly as often as I should - so cancel your subscription :D</p>

<p>So a quick recap of this past weekend - had way too much fun Friday night followed by even more fun Saturday and Sunday.  Spent both days out in the middle of nowhere at the <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/twofour/24.htm">24 Hours of Old Pueblo</a> (<a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/24hop-2005/">pictures here</a>) and got to hang out with a bunch of old <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/24hop-2005/IMG_2849.JPG.html">friends</a> and help their team out.  I didn't race as I could count the number of times I've been on a mountain bike this year on one hand.  A <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/03/20/p543">six hour race</a> might be an ok as a way to start the season off without any training, but a 24 is a totally different thing.</p>

<p>This weekend reminded me of something though: the reason I wanted to move back to the desert in the first place... <em>to ride and race</em>.  I haven't been doing nearly as much of that as I wanted or planned to, but now I'm going to make a conscious effort to start it up again.</p>

<p>Next up for me is <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/default.asp">Dawn 'til Dusk</a> in Gallup, NM.  As it stands now, I'll be doing a co-ed duo with a pretty <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/24hop-2005/IMG_2670.JPG.html">fast chick</a> (3 - or is it 4? - time women's sport champ for NM).  I'm figuring we can probably do pretty decent and I'm hoping to pull in at least 60% of the laps with her helping by giving me some recovery time every lap or two.</p>

<p>I'm headed up to Gallup this weekend for a preview of the course.  With any luck I'll have a couple of the locals showing me around so I make sure to see the actual course as opposed to just riding around for a few hours.</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">Crank</a> declined to sponsor me again.  I'm actually thinking about picking up a jersey and seeing how many racing pictures I can get taken in it this year; then apply again next and just send them pictures. :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I should know better than drunk typing, but...  So you can't say you weren't forewarned.</p>

<p>I've been making some guest appearances on another <a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/">website</a> for the last few days.  I choose a friend's site to come out about my <a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/?p=244">cross dressing ways</a>.  It just felt more comfortable that way, unlike the pearl thong I was wearing that day.  They're fun to play with, but just not that practical for long term wear.</p>

<p>Seriously though, do you ever feel like you're being ganged up on?  I seem to attract this odd following of female bloggers who love to pick on me.  In KC it was the <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/">Superfical Plaza Chick</a>, and now that I've moved out here I've moved on from monogamous "being-picked-on" relationships to swinging relationship where everybody is taking there shot tag team style...  In no particular order:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://mhoover.blogspot.com/2006/02/little-story.html"> A Little Story.... Called....Travis is mean.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mhoover.blogspot.com/2006/02/its-good-thing.html">I have questionable taste</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/?p=240">I'm a cross dresser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/?p=244">I'm hijacking blogs and posting in the future</a>: I might hang out late, but I've never gone home from Christine and Charles' at 1:30 PM on Saturday from the previous night's poker game.</li></ul>

<p>And the topper - I tagged <a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/">Planet Crimson</a> with a "Travis was here" (which in all fairness, I really think I would have been more creative), and I have had a <a href="http://mhoover.blogspot.com/">blogged dedicated</a> (at least parenthetically - a gold star for me, I spelled it right the first time and I'm drunk) to "picking on [me]".</p>

<p>Oh I feel the love... much like a celebrity does when they're being stalked.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/02/13/depends_on_whos_willing_to_do_the_work</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I mean, this kind of depoliticized, cynical population could easily be mobilized by Jimmy Swaggart, or it could be organized by environmentalists.  Mostly it just depends on who's willing to do the work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Words spoken in the spring of 1989...  and they turned out to be prophetic.  It seems the Republicans realized that there existed a largely untapped, but ripe constituency with which to help tilt the elections, those that "could easily be mobilized by Jimmy Swaggart".  So what did they do, for the past two decades they've adopted symbolic causes that rally religious folk and bring them out to the polls.</p>

<p>Case in point, in 2004 we had the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/?s=same%20sex">same sex marriage</a> issue which I blogged about at length during the time.  A bogus issue was created across the country in the early part of '04 when the President came out in support of a constitutional ammendment "enshrining" the institution of marriage.  I believe that someone in the White House probably thought that handling it at the federal level was the choice to make it happen.  Get it on the ballot for November and away you go.  Then someone realized that all you needed to do was get it on the ballot in swing states.  <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/27/the_truth_about_amendment_2">Missouri's Ammendment Two</a> wording even went so far as to specify the date that this pressing issue was to take place.  </p>

<p>Even though there was a Democratic administration in place trying to thwart this gerrymandering of the election, the effect was achieved.   The religious folk were mobilized to prevent gay marriage - and while they were at it they were going to vote Republican.  Never mind that Kerry called for exactly what ended up happening: he supported the state's right of self-determination on the issue; Bush said it belonged to the federal powers.  I shouldn't have to mention the obvious irony in this situation.</p>

<p>Even more, it wasn't a referendum on same sex marriage, but rather a strengthening of the existing laws.  By an act of the legislature in Missouri it was already outlawed, all Ammendment Two did was move it to the Constitution so Missouri judges couldn't claim that they were only following the constitution's policy of equal protection under the law.  All of this was symbolic though, we've had a Republican administration, House, and Senate with the election a full year removed and there hasn't been any further action to "defend" hetro-sexual American's marriages.  </p>

<p>Another one for ya: if abortion was such a big issue, why is it still legal?  Again, there's been a Republican President, Senate, and Congress for over a half decade, and they've yet to devote any real effort to this.  Granted, they do have a Supreme Court tilting that way now, so it will be easier to sneak something in.  They could have gone the constitutional ammendment route; but they've chosen not to.</p>

<p>You would think it would be enough for these zealots to ask themselves what they've gotten in return for their support.  From the outside it sure looks like having the issue is more important to the party than having a real resolution.  But any political party in America <em>manipulating</em> an impressionable constituency with bogus issues?  Please.  What kind of America do you think we live in?  Oh yeah, that's right... one where that would happen without a second thought.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>I wrote this a few weeks back, but it was late at night and I was sure I had all kinds of typos that my middle of the night mind would catch, so I saved it as a draft and just got a chance to go back through it and finish it up tonight.  Enjoy...</fieldset>

        <title>Hairball Run rendering</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/02/09/hairball_run_rendering</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For all my cycling fans (all, what? three or four of you?) I thought you might appreciate this:</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-maps/Hairball+Run.jpg.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/4192-2/Hairball+Run.jpg" alt="Hairball Run at Phoenix Mountain Perserve" /></a></p>

<p>This was my first time on a mountain bike ride in three weeks, and the first time on a bike in almost two.  I've been trying to kick an allergy cold, just hasn't been working.  Anyhow, the lesson learned is that a <abbr title="Tuesday Night HairBall Margirita Ride">TNHBMR</abbr> is not the way to make a comeback.  I had a heartrate reading at one point of 207.  For my readers who don't know what an average heart rate should be, for someone who's fit you generally take 220 minus their age to figure out their <em>max</em> heart rate.  Now I knew my was a tad over 200 (at least with this <abbr title="Heart Rate Monitor">HRM</abbr>), but 207?!  That's bordering on heart explosions.</p>

<p>Anyhow, once I recovered (if you can ever call any part of a ride with an average heart rate of 182 as "recovered"), it was a blast.  This was the first time I've had my <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/bike-harem/standing-strong-bullit.jpg.html">big bike</a> out on any serious trails.  That baby will go anywhere.  I seriously remember thinking "oh shit, just hang on" when I saw a few of the drops.</p>

<p>The irony of the night thought was that this was my first time out with leg armor on a ride...  My legs are kind of long, I've got the 6'+ versions <a href="http://catalog.troyleedesigns.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=100">Troy Lee's big pads</a> and they didn't cover my entire shin.  So I get back from the ride, and literally, right at the point where the skin is exposed, I've got two 1" scraps from a rock or tree or something.  To quote one of the other three brave souls who made the ride Tuesday: "irony is so ironic".</p>

If I would have pushed through the tiredness, I would have been up 'til midnight and tired in the morning when I woke up.  The last few weeks my body just can't seem to figure out which way is up.  One minute I'm tired, the next I'm wide awake.  One minute I can't concentrate enough to read an email start to finish, the next I feel as though I could write a treatise on the cause of global poverty and its solutions (imperialistic (aka, "free market") capitalism is in large part the cause and the introduction of economic protectionism in smaller markets while keeping large markets (US, western Europe, etc.) more open is part of the solution in case you're wondering...).</p>

<p>Ugg... must. get. sleep.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm sitting here waiting on the dryer to finish up reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1565847032%3Fv%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky</a> when I come across a perspective on the reason for keeping marijuana illegal that I hadn't considered before:</p>

<blockquote><p>... ask yourself a simple question: how come marijuana is illegal but tobacco legal?  It can't be because of the health impact, because that's exactly the other way around - there has never been a fatality from marijuana use among 60 million reported users in the United States, whereas tobacco kills hundreds of thousands of people every year <sup><a href="http://understandingpower.com/Chapter2.htm#f32">32</a></sup>.  My strong suspicion, though I don't know how to prove it, is that the reason is that marijuana's a weed, you can grow it in your backyard, so there's nobody who would make any money off it if it were legal.  Tobacco requires extensive capital inputs and technology, and it can be monopolized, so there are people who can make a ton of money off it.  I don't really see any other difference between the two of them, frankly - except that tobacco's far more lethal and far more addictive.</p></blockquote>

<p>That would help explain all of the institutional resistance to medical marijuana.  Drug companies don't want you growing your own treatments, they want you lining up with at the pharmacies for their "cures" - I mean treatments since there's more money treating than there is curing.</p>

<p>Leave it to <a href="http://chomsky.info">Chomsky</a> to state the obvious in a way you've never thought of before.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/01/22/talk_about_a_depressing_movie</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/">Lord of War</a> yesterday and came away from its two hours thoroughly depressed.  The movie's entirety can be summed up in the following quote from Cage's character Yuri Orlov:</p>

<blockquote><p>They say, "Evil prevails when good men fail to act." What they ought to say is, "Evil prevails."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Update</em>: Reading through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/trivia">IMDB's trivia on Lord of War</a> I finally get it.  This movie has the same feel to it that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/">The Terminal</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a> have, it feels real - there isn't a fluffed up Hollywood story to make it feel good, it's more about what is.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629272/">Andrew Niccol</a>, the writer of Lord of War, is responsible in some part for both of those movies.</p>

<p>Other interesting trivia:</p>
<ul><li>They used a real stockpile of over 3,000 AK-47s because it was cheaper than getting prop guns.</li>
<li>Before shooting the scene where tanks were lined up for sale, the filmmaker had to warn NATO, lest they think a real war was being started when they see satellite images of the set.</li>
<li>My personal favorite: <em>No US studios would back the film. Foreign finances were secured instead.</em></li></ul>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/01/16/racing_this_season</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, I've officially spent too much time on my road bike by myself now.  Well, that and coming off of this cold has my lungs all screwed up.  I've just about decided I'm skipping the first race of the <a href="http://www.mbaa.net">MBBA</a> series the end of the month.  I've gone out and done half of the Expert loop twice now (both times with a bit of a cold), and both times I've been sucking wind on it.  I know I'm not up to doing the whole thing right now.  What's weird is that I'm spending less than an hour out on the bike and feeling dead.  I can hop on my road bike for three hours and feel fine.  I've determined my aerobic capacity is ok, I just need to work on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_threshold#Anaerobic_threshold">anaerobic threshold</a> a bit.</p>

<p>So to do that, I'm going to try to get a crit/circuit ride tonight in Fountain Hills.  I talked with the local shop, CG Bikes, over the weekend and one of the owners seems to think there'd be a few people in for a ride like this.  The course I've got picked out to try goes around the fountain park and through one of the neighborhoods by the park.  According to the <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/">Gmaps Pedometer</a> it's just over two miles - too long to be a crit course, too short to be a circuit course.  Anyhow, if I can get a half dozen hammerheads to come out and play once a week on this course for an hour or so, I'll be happy.  Nothing like guys faster than you to push you to go harder.  The course lends itself to a lot of short bursts, especially since we'll have to be slowing down to get back on one of the main roads and turn off of that road.  Should be loads of fun... :-)</p>

<p>In the meantime, that means no Travis racing at races (at least as of tonight) in the first few months of the year.  So all the other Experts in the 19 - 25/29 age brackets throughout the southwest can breath harder now knowing that they aren't guaranteed to stay out of <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/04/18/p565">last place</a> now.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>But hovering really annoys me.  I know it's not the waiters fault.  His job is to keep people moving through the restaurant, but still.  Let me enjoy my meal.  Oh, and the check...  I'll ask for it when I need it.  Hopefully, you'll have it handy since you were thinking ahead, but still.  Putting the check on the table when someone still has food on their plate and saying "no rush" still implies there is a rush.</p>

<p>Ok, so I'm out at Chile's tonight (I know, horrible of me in the first place) enjoying a meal and talking more than I'm eating - a hazard of meals with me I guess.  The waiter asks twice if we're up for desert - amazingly, the answer was no both times.  Then plops the check down with the ol' "no rush" line.  We're enjoying the evening.  The restaurant isn't near capacity, just chill out...</p>

<p>Contrast that with my experience at the <a href="http://www.yardhouse.com/default.asp">Yard House</a> (a chain still, albeit a much smaller one) a while back.  I'm there on a Wednesday, and on this no particular Wednesday there's a 30 minute wait which turns out to be more like 45 minute.  No problem...  I'm going solo, so I'm sure they're not dying to seat me.  Once I do get a seat, I end up being there for nearly 3 hours, eating, chatting with the wait staff, writing, and drinking (<em>note to concerned family members: you know me though, three hours doesn't translate into falling down drunk, I'm a slow drinker</em>).  </p>

<p>Not once during that entire time was I asked if I was ready for my check.  I got it when I was ready and declined when asked if I need anything more.  Think about it.  A hopping restaurant with nearly an hour wait, they seat one guy at a table for four, and not once do they try to run me through the place like I'm cattle on the way to have my wallet slaughtered. It did take a little longer than they said it would, but that was just because they weren't trying to run the other patrons out so they could seat me.  Just like I probably held up a few other people.</p>

<p>I can't really hold my waiter responsible for tonight.  I'm sure he's just following orders from management, who's following orders from corporate, who's following orders from the (hat's off, show some respect) "<em>market</em>".  There's a few lessons to be learned.</p>

<ul><li>Ditch the <em>Wait Staff Phrases for Dummies</em> book.  Learn more than how to ask if they're ready to order and if "everything [was] alright.".</li>
<li>Once someone sits down at a table, they own it until <em>they're</em> ready to leave.  Seriously, just because you say there's no rush, doesn't mean we're taking it that there's no rush.</li>
<li>Unless you're charging to refill whatever is in a glass, there's no appropriate time to ask "would you like a refill."  If it looks like they might need one, go for it.  What do you have to lose except $.025 in liquid and ice?</li>
<li>There is a difference between being unobtrusive and bordering on being rude.  The former is good, the latter is bad; and it's a good idea to be able to recognize the difference.</li>
<li>There is also a subtle difference between these two phrases.  "Are you ready for the check?" and "Is there anything else I can get you?".  If the difference doesn't smack you over the head, consider changing career paths into something less demanding.  If your new job description includes "watching grass grow", it might work for you.</li></ul>

<p>So there's my rant for the week... :)</p>

        <title>New Random CafePress Item plugin</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The attentive eye will notice the new "From My Store" block in the sidebar.  I've created a plug-in for the Phoenix version <a href="http://b2evolution.net">b2evolution</a> that displays links to random CafePress items from any number of CafePress stores.  The code to handle the CafePress portion is based on <a href="http://php.amnuts.com/">Andrew Collington's</a> <a href="http://php.amnuts.com/index.php?do=view&amp;id=13">CafePress Box</a>.  I made a modification to make it work with <a href="http://store.travisswicegood.com/">my cpshop</a> CGI script instead of linking directly to CafePress so I can make things look more "branded".</p>

<p>Anyhow, the <a href="http://b2evolution.net/man/2004/09/26/writing_a_plugin_howto">new plugin system in Phoenix</a> is great.  There's still some undocumented features (like the SkinTag() method that I'm using), but once those get in place this will be a pretty useful system.  Now we just need a nice <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> for installing them and we're set.</p>

<p>As soon as I have a few more free moments to package this up, I'll add it to the <a href="http://plugins.b2evolution.net/">plugins</a> site.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I lose my record of a perfect year of cycling.  I woke up this morning with a slightly sore throat, so you win body.  I know when you push back you mean business, so I'll take today off - maybe tomorrow too.</p>

<p>I'm fine now I think, but my body was getting a little worse for wear with 6 straight days with anywhere between 60 minutes to 5 hours in the saddle with over 120 miles under my belt.  Not a ton, especially compared to some of my previous riding habits, but quite a bit comparied to <em>recent</em> riding habits - especially when you consider over 1/3 is off road and all but 15 or 20 miles on the road was climbing miles.</p>

        <title>One hundred thousand foot man</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man/"/>
        <updated>2006-01-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welp, I hit my goal - and in traditional Travis fashion, I did it in a big kind of way.  I climbed (well, pushed a bit... hey, I was on my 40 pound Bullit!) Sunrise from the east - less than 2 miles and 1,000 vertical feet.  Oh yeah, and I rode to the trailhead from my house (nearly 1,000 up and over by itself).  Total for the day: 2,346 gained in 11.83 miles.</p>

<p>So, the grand totals for the year:</p>

<table><tr><th>Saddle Time</th><th>Miles</th><th>Climbed</th><th>Descended</th></tr><tr><td>85 hours (approx)*</td><td>1,181.52 miles</td><td>102,158 feet</td><td>103,451 feet</td></tr></table>

<p>I say approximate on the saddle time because I goofed a few times when I first got my GPS and have a couple of nearly 100 rides...</p>

<p>And what did I do when I got through finishing up two days of climbing and my first (known) 100,000 foot year?  I when another semi-epic ride.  23.72 miles - on my Sugar this time - and back over to the Sonoran Mtn. Perserve.  Since I didn't see enough of it the first time, I did all of the trails I know about, including Sunrise from the West.  </p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-maps/Sunrise+Climb.jpg.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/4177-2/Sunrise+Climb.jpg" alt="Sunrise climb" title="" /></a></p>

<p>And then descended down the west side again:</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-maps/Sunrise+Descent.jpg.html"><img src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/4182-2/Sunrise+Descent.jpg" alt="Sunrise West Descent" title="Sunrise West Descent" /></a></p>

<p>The descent is definitely much more enjoyable on the Bullit than on the Sugar, although pushing the Bullit up the climbs is a pain.  Anyhow, what a way to ring in the new year.  3 days of riding and 9,810 feet of climbing.  Did a mention my legs are a little heavy today?</p>

        <title>The hills, they mock me</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/12/30/the_hills_they_mock_me/"/>
        <updated>2005-12-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/12/30/the_hills_they_mock_me</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so this morning I was sitting around 96k and change on total vertical feet climbed since I got my <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner301/">Forerunner 301</a> back in May (26th is my first recorded ride).  So, what's there to do but go get that extra 4k feet in climbing.  I live in Fountain <em>Hills</em>, so it should be easy enough, right?  Well, I went and did every climb I could find, including no fewer than 3 climbs with a gradient over 16% (including one that's flagged by the city as 18%).  An hour and a half and 26 miles later, I was 3.3k closer to the 100k mark.</p>

<p>Run the totals again to see where I'm at.  I've got 101.1k feet descending, and what's that, vertical feet are being condescending to me: 99,812 feet.  I started to put my shoes back on and go climb El Lago one more time to make the last mark, but my legs protested.  So tomorrow, I've got to go climb El Lago, or Pallisades, one more time so I can have climbed 100k in less than 6 months of really spotty riding.</p>

<p>So next year?  Well, it's going to be at least a half million foot year for me.  Taking the last two month's worth of riding and extrapolating it out to a full year, I would have climbed 221k feet (that's 18 rides in roughly 60 days - I know I can do better than that).  So, there's the goal.  500k is doable - actually, it should be the standard mark for me.  So far this year, my rides have averaged roughly 2k.  If I ride five days a week at that, I'll be over 500k by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Now, if I can outdo Mark Weir of WTB - he managed over a million this past year (with 365 days of riding) - that'll be awesome.</p>

        <title>I'm officially out of the mainstream</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/12/29/i_m_officially_out_of_the_mainstream</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not that this would surprise anyone who knows me, but I took myself out of the mainstream today.  I left the 75% of Americans who have cable or satellite TV and have gone the route of a plain of TV with a DVD player hooked up.</p>

<p>Here's my justification - TV is too easy.  A DVD - be it a movie to TV show on DVD - requires some commitment.  It means telling yourself that I'm going to be occupied for the next 30 minutes to 3 hours.  A TV just requires that your remote have working batteries.  So I found myself killing 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there, an hour over there watching the TV when there was nothing really good on.  I'd turn on the news and watch it while I ate breakfast.  Lunch, dinner?  A good time to see what's happening in the world from the view point of Discovery or CNN.  Nothing but the laundry to do?  Let's see if there's anything good on TV.</p>

<p>So I was paying $40 a month to piss away my days 10 minutes at a time.  That time is much better spent writing, fiddling with or riding one of my bikes, or just doing nothing.  Sometimes, with all the distractions we set up for ourselves, the sheer conscious act of doing nothing is all you need to unwind from the day.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And tonight, they seemed to be that way.  At the weekly poker tournament at friend's house, I played pretty well.  Lost two hands where I bet heavy on three of a kind only to loose to a full house and a straight - both times to the same guy who's known for bluffing.  I think I called the two hands he really made.</p>

<p>After a re-buy about an hour into the night, I managed to make it to the final table and got into a heads-up match around 12:30.  An hour later, we're both still at it going back and forth with the winner taking home $150, the looser taking home $20.  After several all-ins, most of which worked, some didn't, we're at almost even.  I've got Ace 9, and the flop is a 9 high bunch of trash.  I've got the best hand out, short of her having  a pocket pair.  Based on the way she's betting the hand, she doesn't have it.  I go all in, she calls.  She's Ace 4 - she has nothing on the board but Ace high.  I've got it, and the chip lead...</p>

<p>Until she draws two fours.</p>

<p>To quote  the dealer - a shock wave came out of that second four as it flipped over.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok... I finally snapped.  No longer will comments be allows from sites that have BlogSpot.com URLs.  Sorry, I know of at least three of you that comment from time to time that have blogspot blogs.  Just don't include your website address and you'll be fine.</p>

<p>The reason for this?  About the gazillionth comment spam from "go--get-some-action.blogspot.com" this morning.  I literally spent 45 minutes cleaning out spam from the last week.  There were probably three dozen different blogspot blogs that were being used to spam the site.  The problem was that they would leave one or two comments and that was it.  It wasn't like the sitewide spam where you get 100 of the same address that's easy to pick out, these were individual ones that you have to go through and delete... one, by one, by one, by one.  So, no more blogspot.  If you're really pissed, feel free to complain to blogspot about their shoddy verification process.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's note</legend>Sorry if this seems a little bitchy.  It's 8 AM here and I've officially been up for more than 6 hours...  That coupled with the nearly 1,500 spam emails I've received in the last week (all of which were generated by some moron who has a domain51 email address in their address book and has an infected computer and won't get it fixed because they are too dumb, lazy, or some combination of the two), the 450 or so comment/trackback spams I got on my blogs, and the fact taht I woke up at 1:30 and tossed and turned until 4...I think I'm a wee bit entitled.</fieldset>

        <title>God Bless Mr. Cuervo...</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/11/17/god_bless_mr_cuervo</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And whoever "hecho" him the first time.  I got introduced the hard way to the "Waterfall" in South Mountain tonight.  I didn't actually do Waterfall, which would have been a better story - but such is life.  Anyhow, at the bottom of it there's a little rock shelf that I just climbed up and we've seen the Waterfall, Brett did the Waterfall, I walked it, now it's time to go back.  So I hop on my bike, and start going.  I'm not exactly sure what happened next - I know I stalled out and went down... knee first.  </p>

<p>Wait, I just re-read that and it sounds like I blacked out.  I didn't.  I was fully aware the whole time.  Nothing got broken and I rode out under my own power.  Shell shocked and pussing out on everything steeper than 6", but still under my own power.</p>

<p>Ok, so back to the wreck.  I'm on top of this little rock shelf like thing.  It's off camber, and when I stall out, I fall to the off camber - naturally.  When I come to the unintentially abrupt stop, I'm now about 18" lower than where my bike was when I started.  Being the trained <a href="http://www.imba.com/nmbp/index.html">National Mountain Bike Patroler</a> that I am really helped out.  I knew all of the proper curses and the correct order in which to say them.  I start checking myself to make sure everything's ok.  I notice a nice little patch of blood coming from my knee and start checking it.  You know you've had a bad one when the guy behind you sees you checking your wound and asks "Is it bone or blood". :D</p>

<p>After that, I just couldn't get my mojo on on the downhill.  I walked a ton of stuff I know I can bomb through, but such is the way it goes.  If you don't have your mojo, you're walking.</p>

<p>Back to Mr. Cuervo - I got home and after 40 minutes of driving my legs gotten nice and stiff and has the dull ache to it.  Rather than start popping bills, I remembered the bottle of Jose Cuervo I picked up the other night at the store.  It did quite nicely helping ease the pain.  Now it's started me wondering.  Would it work as a preventative medicine?  Of course, I'd have to figure out how to get home after the ride, but a shot before hand would give it plenty of time to work its way through my system and give me the full benefit of deadening any pain prior to the pain actually happening.  This might require further study.  :D</p>

<p>Actually, Big D and Smokin' Ray should have plenty of field experience with this - I'll just ask them for proper doses, the amount of time prior to the ride that it should be taken for maximum effectiveness, etc.  I'm sure through trial and error they've got it worked out.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>No - I'm not drunk.  Happily buzzed from my half shot, yes.  Drunk, no.  And yes... it only takes a half shot to give me a nice buzz.  One of the nice (bad?) things of having a body fat around 10% - alcohol will do its thing quickly.</fieldset>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went out last night to do a ride in the McDowells.  Got there with what I thought was two hours of light, forgot about the time change and all.  Anyhow, I head out on the "Long Loop" thinking I've got plenty of time.  I make it to the turn around point, and bail out to the main road as I approach civil twilight...  I just know I'm going to get a ticket for being in the park after sunset.  That is, if I'm even able to get back in to get my car.  As I make it back to the parking lot, sure enough there's a pick-up parked next to me that wasn't there when I left.  He's backing out and as he turns around and sees me coming up the parking lot to him, he stops and turns his lights off.  Great, a ticket my first time out here.  As I approach, he's writing something... A ticket I'm sure.  I speak as I ride by, hop off the bike and start putting my stuff up.  Mystery guy is still sitting in his truck doing something.  I'm just about through packing up and he drives off, no nothing.  Guess I dodged a bullet.</p>

<p>As I'm out on the trail and it becomes obvious that it's going to be well after sunset (when the park closes) when I get back, I actually thought about pulling my spare tube out of my Camelbak and poking a hole in it so I had a good excuse.  As it stood in my mind's eye, Mr. County Park Ranger was going to say "yeah, you should have" when I offered my excuse of "I should have known better than to start a trail called the 'Long Loop' when it was as close to dark as it was.  I just misjudged it."</p>

<p>Fun trails, but I just can't understand why there are so many fall-line trails.  I'm not talking just close to fall-line, I mean straight down the hill.  Sure, they're fun, but man are they eroded.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I've been meaning to do this all week - time just hasn't cooperated.  I'm in Fountain Hills now.  The weather out here has been great, and I've gotten in a few great rides since I've been out here.  My apartment is still a disaster... I intended to work on it a bit yesterday, but after a little over five hours (yes, as in 300 minutes) on my road bike in the morning, I decided I would just take it easy for the day so that makes today's project a bit of cleaning up around here.</p>

<p>Note to self: just because the mountains are over there, doesn't always mean you have to go over there :)</p>

        <title>Greetings from the road...</title>

        <updated>2005-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/10/28/greetings_from_the_road</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, by the time you guys get to read this, I should be the other side of Wichita, somewhere on Highway 54 headed towards my new abode in the Valley of the Sun.  A friend I hadn't talked with in a while emailed Wednesday to see how things were going, to see when the move was going to take place, and to let me know I had enriched his life with my time here in KC.  He reminded me what an effect everyone here in KC - friends, family, co-workers, random strangers I met in bookstores - has had on me.  Sometimes, especially when you're about to move on, you wonder what kind of effect your presence has had on those around you.  We don't tell those around us often enough how much they effect us, but I'm going to attempt to let you in on the effect KC and it's denizens have had on me.  I'm leaving names out, because I would surely forget someone...</p>

<p>Some of you have provided me insight into new ideas or brought old ones into a new light; others have helped reinforce my own ideals.  Some of you have provided the occasional thought provoking conversation or blog posting, while others have provided a constant stream of humor (sometimes, at my own expense).  Some of you have inspired me to be better at what I do; others have outright enabled it.  Some of you have provided two years of comradery, while others I've only know for a few short weeks or months.  </p>

<p>No matter who you are, how well we know each other, or for how long, you've provided me with something I'll take with me as I move on to this next stage in my life.  There are a few of you I wish I could have known better.  In particular, one I wish I could have known without the pending move in the background...</p>

<p>One thing you always wonder when you're about to make a change like this in your life: is it the right thing?  This move, I'm certain, is the right thing for me to do.  As most of you who have read this site probably gather, I'm not a religious person but rather a spiritual one.  I don't believe there's an Almighty up above acting as a puppet master to set us on a predetermined path, but I do believe if we make our intentions known, we can surround ourselves with events that will make those intentions come to fruition.  Earlier this year, while saying goodbye to extended family from the panhandle of Texas, I was reminded that I always have a place to stay with them if I make it out that direction.  My response was, "If I had a job, I'd be out there tomorrow."  I went on to explain that the southwest is my home and where I want to end up. Within the week, through a "random" series of events I discovered the company's website  that listed the position I'm now filling.</p>

<p>The hand of God?  My internal servo-mechanism?  An infected quantum field that had no choice but to follow my wishes?  Just dumb luck?  I'm not sure on that part, yet I know this is what I should be doing.  I also know that you've provided me with a few new standpoints on life, and for that I'm thankful.</p>

<p>This site will still be here and provide what it's always has.  Now it'll just be based a handful of degrees of longitude and latitude to the west and south.</p>

<p>Thanks for <em>knowing</em> me... :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Less than a week to go...  I'm excited.  I've found the best way to describe it is anxious anticipation.  I can't wait to be back "home" in the desert, but it is going to be wierd being half a country away from my family.</p>

<p>I'm down to the final things to pack - my books, my bikes, and my computers.  I started my books today and all of my miscellaneous biking stuff is already packed up. I still have all my bikes out though, and hope to get in another ride before I head out west.  With the weather of late, I don't think it's going to cooperate.</p>

<p>Back to the grindstone.  I need to get my room back to some semblance of ordered so I have room to sleep tonight.  If you're curious what my nephew looks like, check out these <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/swicegood-family/the-jones/alexander-james/">pictures</a> I took the other day.  My favorites are <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/swicegood-family/the-jones/alexander-james/dsc05656-005-bw.jpg.html">this one</a> and <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/swicegood-family/the-jones/alexander-james/dsc05643-003-bw2.jpg.html">this one</a> - I just wish the first one was in focus, but he was moving so fast I couldn't keep him perfectly in focus.  I have to give <a href="http://aptrick.deviantart.com/">Pappy</a> props on the idea for the border.  He uses a different aspect ratio than I do, but I love the black band idea.</p>

        <title>New photo site</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/10/12/new_photo_site</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend I upgrade to <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery2</a>.  What a great piece of software.  Last night I put the finishing touches on making it look sort of like this site, and got everything moved over to its new home, <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/">photos.travisswicegood.com</a>.  In addition, I've put up the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/photo-dump/sept-24-28-trip/">photo dump</a> of all my pictures while I was out in Arizona a few weeks ago.  There's over 250 in there, so some of the highlights include these <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/photo-dump/sept-24-28-trip/?g2_page=15">sunset pictures</a> and one of my favorites from the trip, <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/photo-dump/sept-24-28-trip/dsc05610.jpg.html">this lightning</a> caught from the plane on the trip back.</p>

<p>Last night while I was waiting on all those photos to get transferred to my server, I did do some editing and ended up with <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/">these photos</a>.  In <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/grand-canyon-explorer.jpg.html">this picture of the Grand Canyon</a>, there's a guy in blue just under the bush in the upper left.  If you can see the speck that he is, it  really helps put the scale of that picture in perspective.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can't believe it's Friday.  I had planned to have more of my stuff packed by now, but by the time I get to the evening I'm looking to just veg out.  This means I get to spend the majority of my weekend packing so I can make up for lost time.  I've just about got all my non-essential bike shop type stuff packed.  Except for books, that's the biggest part of my stuff I have to round up and get packed and ready.  </p>

<p>You know... I kind of enjoy the post-move part of the move.  The new place, new people, new things to do; all that's great.  The packing part though... I could do without it.</p>

<p>On the bike front, I've got a new ride.  A few weeks back my road bike's rear shifter checked out.  I was planning on buying a new bike the first part of next year, so I thought it was kind of dumb to sink $250 or so into a bike I'm getting ready to hang up.  A couple shops later I found a great deal on pretty much what I wanted.  Had the Ultegra groupo and was carbon... Meet my new <a href="http://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/030.000.000/030.000.000.asp?model=11211">TCR Limited</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/TCR-Limited.jpg" alt="Travis' TCR Limited" /></p>

<p>Ok, so that isn't exactly my bike, but it's what it looks like.  With a different saddle, pedals, and my <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner301/">Forerunner</a> on the handlebars.  One of these days I'll actually get around to taking some pictures of it and la arana and posting them.</p>

        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/09/29/update_on_the_impending_move/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/09/29/update_on_the_impending_move</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I've <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/08/03/which_way_does_jet_lag_work">posted before</a>, I'm on my way out of Kansas City.  The past few days in Phoenix were used to find a place to live.  I've got everything lined up now, and will be heading out for <a href="http://www.fh.az.gov/">Fountain Hills, AZ</a> (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_Hills%2C_AZ">Wikipedia entry</a>) the end of October.</p>

<p>While I was out there, I went up to <a href="http://www.flagstaff.az.gov/">Flagstaff, AZ</a>.  Talk about a cool town.  Everybody was on bikes it seemed.  There was a lot of tourist traffic still with people trying to get out of the heat of Phoenix, but it was still a great place.  Saturday night, I ate at the <a href="http://www.beaverstreetbrewery.com/">Beaver Street Brewery</a>.  Their pizza was amazing and the beer was pretty tasty as well.  What made the night though was their Katrina fundraiser.  All of profits from Saturday were being donated to the relief effort and all the waiters and waitresses were throwing in their tips.  The service was outstanding, so he would have gotten a good tip anyhow, but with the moneys going to charity he got what I imagine was probably one of his larger tips of the evening - somewhere around 50% of the bill.</p>

<p>Sunday was spent up in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/">Grand Canyon</a> (I'll post pictures soon), and <a href="http://www.cityofprescott.net/">Prescott, AZ</a>.  Cool little town, but I think I liked the atmosphere of Flagstaff better.  </p>

<p>The rest of the time was spent wondering around Phoenix, checking out apartments and the like.  It's a cool city.  A ton of people, but a cool city nonetheless.</p>

        <title>Something new in need of a second opinion</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/09/29/something_new_in_need_of_a_second_opinio/"/>
        <updated>2005-09-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/09/29/something_new_in_need_of_a_second_opinio</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm back in Kansas City now.  Great trip and I'm surprised I don't have a cold this morning.  Yesterday when I left Phoenix it was in the upper 90s - when I got back here it was in the 50s!  Before you say anything about that being oppressively hot, it's not.  I wore a long sleeved shirt on Tuesday and it was up over 100.  It didn't feel any worse than mid to upper 80s with a lot of humidity here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's not what I'm looking for some commentary on.  I'm out in Phoenix with a group of mostly guys in my industry (read: a bunch of programming geeks) for some pizza and beer (Fat Tire + tap + cold mug = mmm).  The waitress is cute and has what I swore was an east Texas accent though I missed it by about 1000 miles to the NW - she was from Colorado.  She said she gets that a lot though, so thankfully it wasn't the New Belgium messing up my hearing.  I'm familiar with  beer goggles, but beermuffs?  Apparently, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=beermuffs">yes</a>, but they are rarely sighted with Google only know of 40 in the wild.  I digress, back to my story.</p>

<p>Here's the part that threw me...  I'm giving her back the "merchant copy" of my receipt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you seeing anybody?<br />
<em>Cute Waitress: (sheepishly, not as in "eww, that creep with a mullet just asked me out" - inside joke) Yeah...</em><br />
Me: Ahh... Is it serious?<br />
<em>CW: Well... yes and no.</em><br />
Me: Yes and no?<br />
<em>CW: Well, more yes than no.</em><br />
Me: Oh, well ok.<br />
<em>CW: But you can check back with me...</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This was followed by her giving me her work schedule...  </p>

<p>Two questions.  First, what the hell does "yes and no" mean?  There's a hundred different ways to read that.  Second, what's with the "check back with me"?  Sort of reminds me of a relationship voicemail: "I'm sorry, but someone else is currently occupying my time, if you'd like to leave your name and number, I'll call you just as soon as I get loose interest... *beep*"  Did I mention I don't care for voicemail/answering machines?  Yeah, yeah, I know it's not that bad and I imagine she didn't quite mean it like that.  Given the previous yes and no comment and the fact that she knows my timetable to moving to the area (a month by the way), its entirely possible that Mr. Yes and No has a few more weeks to from Mr. Yes and No to Mr. Yes or he'll be on the street, but still it was a weird answer and one I haven't gotten before.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I know there's a few women out there who read this site, so feel free to answer my questions.  Remember, she's not local so you should feel no solidarity with her. ;)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don't normally post comments I make on other blogs as a main post here, but I thought the comment to <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/index.php?title=title_5&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">this post</a> was worthwhile...</p>

<ul>
<li>... hundreds killed or mamed when <em>Christians</em> bombed each other in Ireland</li>
<li>... thousands slaughtered when <em>Christians</em> followed the orders of politically challenged Popes and invalided the middle east</li>
<li>... tens of thousands of his own people maimed or killed when a <em>Christian</em> President ordered the overthrow of a dictator</li>
<li>... tens of thousands of another country maimed or killed when a <em>Christian</em> President ordered the overthrow of a dictator</li>
<li>... the doctors and nurses killed when <em>Christians</em> bombed an abortion clinic.</li>
<li>... untold hundreds harassed, beat, and in some cases killed when <em>Christians</em> got uncomfortable with someone else's sexuality</li></ul>

<p>I could go on... but lets move to the next one.</p>

<ul>
<li>... 91 people killed when <em>Jews</em> blew up the King David Hotel in July of '46 in a bid for indepdence from a foreign power they deemed an "occupier" (sounds vaguely familiar, huh?)</li>
<li>... more than 10,000 killed during the Six Days War when <em>Jews</em> seized the Gaza Strip</li>
<li>... countless number of civilians have had their lives altered by living under an occupying force and the constant threat of violence under <em>Jewish</em> authority in the occupied territories</li></ul>

<p>Shall we continue down this path?  How 'bout the people we call "fanatics", but who in their day were closer to mainstream than is comfortable to remember.</p>

<ul>
<li>... millions of Jews killed at the hands of a <em>white supremist</em> who believed he was carrying out divine plan.</li>
<li>... thousands of blacks hung by <em>Christians</em> believing they were protecting themselves from savages.</li>
<li>... thousands tortured and killed by <em>Christians</em> for being heretics.</li>
<li>... twenty, including an ordained minister, killed by <em>Christians</em> after being convicted of witchcraft.</li>
<li>... more than two thousand killed in a surprise attack by soliders believing their emperor was god.</li>
<li>...twenty million more or less - as in 20,000,000-/+ -  killed on all sides because conditions were allowed to exist in which countries felt they could only work out their differences and correct the wrongs done them with the barrel of a gun or the bomb bay of a bomber - every side believing their god was supreme and would see their side to victory.</li></ul>

<p>See a common theme here?  I think I'll be boycotting all religious stamps from the USPS.  "God bless the Atheist... For he kills not in Your name." (shirts coming soon...)</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/09/03/the_memory_hole_beckons</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've found the first case of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a> being employed in the wake of Katrina, the government has begun pulling websites that say it knew what might happen in Lousiana.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, I heard Fox doing their "fair and balanced" bit by having a left leaning eco-nut (as the interoffice memo probably refered to him) on one of their shows in the middle of the day, probably about 40 minutes past the hour to insure no one would actually see him - except me as I was eating lunch at the time.  Anyhow, he kept throwing out that the government has known that the destruction of the Mississippi wetlands posed a serious risk to just this type of issue with a big hurricane.  The coastal regions of Lousiana have been losing 25 - 35 square miles of land each year.  This brings the water in closer proximity to people, and lowers the required amount of water needed for a serious flood.</p>

<p>I was just reading through some of the latest news and trying to verify some of the things I've heard earlier in the week.  The commentator on Fox said that it would have taken $15 billion to fix the problem, but no one wanted to step up to the plate for that kind of money.  Of course, if the wetlands could have created <a href="">IEDs</a>, I'm sure we could have declared war on them and figured out a way to rebuild the wetland way of life, but that's another story.  Anyhow, Google came to the rescue when I searched for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=cost%20to%20fix%20the%20mississippi%20delta">cost to fix the mississippi delta</a>.  #4 is a link to the <a href="http://www.asce.org/responds.html">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> and their July 2004 - yes, let that sink in - their <strong>July 2004</strong> article entitled <a href="http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/ceonline04/0704feat.html">Reengineering the Mississippi</a> in which they mention the following...</p>

<blockquote><p>In <strong><em>1998</em></strong> the State of Louisiana and the federal agencies involved in the reclamation and preservation of Louisiana's coastal wetlands developed a new coastal restoration plan, Coast 2050: Toward a Sustainable Coastal Louisiana. The goal of the plan is to restore or mimic the natural processes that formed and sustained the Mississippi River Delta. This will require basinwide action to reestablish or simulate the natural hydrology and sediment introduction processes. Coast 2050 named some 500 potential projects and estimated the total cost at $14 billion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine... Folks, we're talking 7 years ago!  They knew this was a problem and came up with a solution <strong>7 years ago</strong>!</p>

<p>Ok, but the rabbit hole doesn't end there.  Now I've verified the dollar amount by a billion dollars.  We're at $14 billion, or three months worth of our expenses in Iraq to save American lives and insure the future stability of an entire region of our country.  Time to find out about this "Coast 2050" project.  Google again, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Coast%202050">Coast 2050</a> which couldn't have been more helpful.  They even set up a site for their project report...  But wait, what's this?</p>

<p>A 404 error from the USGS - and shit... 10 minutes ago I could have got a screen shot with the logo the address, everything, but now it seems the server won't even respond from here.  I can access the site from my server, so it is still up.  Here's the text that's coming up</p>

<p>Folks - that is being tampered with right now...  I could access it as <a href="http://www.coast2050.com">www.coast2050.com</a>, but now it's only responding to coast2050.com.

<blockquote><p>Wetland loss in coastal Louisiana has reached catastrophic proportions, with current losses of 25-35 square miles per year. Since the magnitude of the problem was identified in the 1970s, we have gained much insight into the processes that lead to wetland creation and destruction. The disappearance of Louisiana?s wetlands threatens the enormous productivity of its coastal ecosystems, the economic viability of its industries, and the <strong>safety of its residents</strong>. </p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine again, but this is unbelievable.  An enterprising journalist should file a freedom of information act suit for the server logs from the webserver that houses coast2050.gov and figure out when it was pulled.  If it was pulled this last week, this is the smoking gun that points the finger at everyone who has ever seen the Coast 2050 report and whoever ordered that the site be pulled.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'll have more on this as I mull it over, but this is flooring me at the moment.</p>

        <title>Tales from Domain51 Content Repository</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/08/22/tales_from_domain51_content_repository/"/>
        <updated>2005-08-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/08/22/tales_from_domain51_content_repository</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For any of you who following my <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/">Subversion repository</a>, and from the looks of the stats on that site, that would appear to be none of you, you would know that I've been working on implementing my <a href="http://list.domain51.net/pipermail/d51toolkit-dev/2005-July/000001.html">Domain51 Content Repository</a> (d51CR).  I've got a lot of the basics out of the way and have started implementing node types and definitions.  I'll save you from a full explanation, but a quick understanding of what they are is necessary for the rest of this...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>d51CR implements a PHP version of Java's JSR-170, or the Java Content Repository.  The idea is to provide a universal API for accessing data within a repository, be it a file system, forum, or blog.  All of them accomplish the same goals, creating nodes that contain properties (or content), JSR-170 just codifies a means of retrieving that data.  With d51CR, my goal is to provide a system that abstracts data in such a way that it can contain any type of data and work just fine.  Think of it as a universal object persistence system.</p>

<p>Now, the node types... Each node could have a node type which defines how that node will behave.  As an example, a folder might implement the nt:folder type which would say that it could have children nodes, while a file might implement nt:file which would say that it couldn't have children nodes.  That's the bird's eye view anyway.</p>

<p>So I got to the point toward the end of last week and into the weekend that I was implementing d51NodeTypes (my code for handling node types) and I went about it the normal way.  Created a nodeTypes table in the database, added the fields I needed, and away I went.  Then I started reading the <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/NonOriginal/jsr170-1.0/spec/jsr170-1.0.pdf">JSR-170 Spec</a> which talks about implementing them inside the actual repository.  Well duh.  Here I am building a content repository to store <em>content</em>, and I'm putting some of that content in other tables.  </p>

<p>I've had a few discussions over the past few months with various other developers about my plans and the one thing I've heard time and time again is that it probably won't perform as well as creating straight tables storing the data you want.  As I thought about rewriting the node types to be stored inside the repository, it dawned on me that I had an opportunity to test these theories and see how they panned out.  The results... Well, they surprised me.</p>

<p>For starters, I had to create a new test database that contained all the new nodes I needed to store.  I got that up and running, finding a few bugs along the way, squashed them, and put unit tests in to make sure they don't pop up again.  By the time I got done the new data in the repository had caused the number of tests being run to grow from 510 in the old system to 621 in the new.  Each test can reset the database and since the new system will take longer to reset, I factored in a way for guestimating how long the database reset takes.  Each test starts off with two resets and it times the second reset figuring it will be approximately the same as subsequent resets.  It calculates the total time to run the tests and subtracts out what the approximate time spent resetting the database.</p>

<p>I'll let the numbers speak here:</p>
<ul><li><p>Testing the new abstract system:</p>
<pre>Executed in 1.1406052112579
Executed in 1.0612101554871
Executed in 1.504843711853
Executed in 1.0510931015015
Executed in 1.1378743648529
Executed in 1.0988252162933
Total: 6.991
Average: 1.165 / 621 = 0.00187 per test</pre></li>
<li><p>Testing the old "standard" system:</p>
<pre>Executed in 0.50116372108459
Executed in 0.90583300590515
Executed in 0.98401999473572
Executed in 0.96339273452759
Executed in 0.97033905982971
Executed in 0.78611278533936

Total: 5.116
Average: 0.852 / 510 = 0.00167 per test</pre></li></ul>

<p>Those numbers are very close, but you'll notice that the first test of the new system seems abnormally low.  Figuring that something may have thrown it off, I decided to pull the highest and lowest times from each and recalculate the averages:</p>

<ul><li>Average per test with abstract system: 0.00178 per test</li>
<li>Average per test with "standard" system: 0.00180 per test</li></ul>


<p>I did a double take when I saw those the first time, too.  What makes this that much more impressive is that the new system has to parse a quasi-XPath query and translate it into an executable SQL statement prior to executing it while the older system executes it directly against the database access object.  I know this is a small sampling of how this will actually work in the real-world, but it does bode well seeing that it can take on a handful of node types and come out to the good.</p>

<p>Just FYI, the query it is performing is to see if a node type has the property of "isMixin" (does it play well with other node types, basically).  In the standard system the query was along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>SELECT * FROM nodeTypes WHERE isMixin = 1</code></p></blockquote>

<p>The XPath to make that happen looks like:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>/d51cr:nodeTypes/[@isMixin = TRUE]</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Which translates into:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>SELECT t2.* FROM <br />
  items AS t0, <br />
  items AS t1,<br />
  items AS t2<br />
  JOIN items AS t3 ON (t2.uuid = t3.parent_id)<br />
  JOIN booleanProperties AS p ON (t3.uuid = p.item_id)<br />
WHERE<br />
  t0.name = "ROOT" AND <br />
  t1.name = "d51cr:nodeTypes" AND <br />
  t0.uuid = t1.parent_id AND <br />
  t2.lft &gt; t1.lft AND t2.rgt &lt; t1.rgt AND <br />
  t3.name = "d51cr:isMixin" AND p.value = "1"<br />
</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, the second should be the slower of the two.  If the second SQL query odd and you've never seen "lft" or "rgt" in an SQL statement before, check out <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/print/hierarchical-data-database">this article on SitePoint</a> for an explanation of the modified preorder tree traversal algorithm.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it looks like I'm going to rewrite a few other parts of d51CR to store their data inside the items table as well.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear WalMart,</p>

<p>Ok... <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/D68CD3BC09EC17C98625705F0015F59F?OpenDocument">this</a> does it.  I am never, ever, shopping at your stores again.  Period.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first time I was there in months.  A lady asked for a jump and your store happened to be closer than home or any other auto parts store - you know, those "speciality" stores we used to have before you ran them all out of business? - that I could think of to go pick up a pair of jumper cables, so I went in and bought a set.  I will be taking them back in the next day or so, then I will never set foot in one of your stores again.</p>

<p>Why?  Because of this (quoted from <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/D68CD3BC09EC17C98625705F0015F59F?OpenDocument">this STLToday.com article</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Debbie Shank stocked shelves at a Wal-Mart store in Cape Girardeau, Mo., until five years ago, when her minivan was hit by a tractor-trailer. Her Wal-Mart health insurance paid the medical bills....</p>

<p>Brain damage forces her to use a wheelchair and limits her upper body movement to one arm and two fingers. It stole her memory and her ability to talk to her husband and three sons.</p>

<p>Now the Shanks face a new obstacle. Her Wal-Mart health insurance plan wants the lawsuit money to repay its costs.</p>

<p>Last week, the health plan sued Debbie Shank in federal court in St. Louis, demanding the full $417,000 she got in the civil suit - plus at least $51,000 more from the share that already went to lawyers and costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>To this, I say a hardy "go screw yourself with a splintered broom".  I'm done.  I know me as one individual won't make a bit of difference to your "competitiveness", or your bottom line, but there are others like me...</p>

<p>There are people who are fed up with being dictated to.  We're tired of disappearing in acres of "The low price" with that cheap marketing creation of yours smirking back at us.  We're tired of seeing entire commercial districts of towns shut down because they can't compete with your modern version of rape and pillage.  Yes, there are other's like me.  And there are people who will be done with you once they know the effect you have.  Together, we'll drive you from our lives the way we've ridded ourselves of every other disease and malady that we've created.</p>

<p>Have a nice day and enjoy your time as the giant you are, it <em>is</em> limited.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

        <title>assert(): Good or evil?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/08/09/assert_good_or_evil/"/>
        <updated>2005-08-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/08/09/assert_good_or_evil</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Obligatory warning: this is tech talk, so if you're not a programmer, your eyes may glaze over...</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh Eichorn</a> and I got into a <a href="http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/savant-talk/2005-August/001009.html">discussion</a> on the Savant mailing list about the use of <a href="http://www.php.net/assert">assert()</a> in PHP scripts.  Personally, I use them everywhere.  They're a great little tool for determining that things meet your expectations.  Josh was concerned that each call to assert() was evaluating the code contained and that was taking up resources.  Later that day, he <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/archives/2005/08/01/using-eval-in-php/">posted a benchmark</a> on the use of eval().  </p>

<!--more-->

<p>He's partially correct.  assert() does call eval() whenever the the argument passed into it is a string.  The benefit to passing the assertion in as a string is that you get feedback as to what's happening.  Look at these examples:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>&lt;?php assert('true == false'); ?&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Which generates:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Warning</b>:  assert(): Assertion &quot;true == false&quot; failed in <b>true-false-single-quote.php</b> on line <b>1</b></p></blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>&lt;?php assert(true == false); ?&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Which generates</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Warning</b>:  assert(): Assertion failed in <b>true-false-no-quote.php</b> on line <b>1</b></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, from a debugging standpoint, the single-quote assert() provides a quick reference as to what went wrong without having to load the code.  That can be a time saver, but the question we have to ask ourselves as programmers is 15 - 30 seconds of our time worth that many times over during the lifespan of the software we're creating?</p>

<p>The only way to know this for sure is to run some benchmark tests.  Josh already put together a simple speed tester, and I've poached it and repurposed it for my tests.  The code is available in my <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/articles/assert-good-or-evil/">Subversion server</a>, so I won't post it here.</p>

<p>The first test we're going to run is just a <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/articles/assert-good-or-evil/basicAssert.php">basic set of assert()</a> methods to see which performs the best.  In addition to comparing single-quote and no-quote assert()s, I've also thrown in the function my_assert() to see if it can operate any faster if I cut all the extra stuff that assert() has to do out.</p>

<p>Here's the three lines we'll be testing:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>assert('$b &lt; $i');<br />
assert($b &lt; $i);<br />
my_assert($b &lt; $i);</code></p></blockquote>

<p>And the results from PHP 4.3.11 (ubuntu install):</p>
<blockquote><p>Single quote assert: 1000000 times took 16.933998<br />
Straight assert: 1000000 times took 1.708551<br />
Using custom assert: 1000000 times took 2.727314</p></blockquote>

<p>You can see right off the bat that Josh was right about the execution time.  Having assert() with single-quotes kills performance.  996% to be exact.  I'm going to leave all my single-quote asserts in place, however, because as the manual says, one of "[t]he advantages of a string assertion are less overhead when assertion checking is off..."  Using a quick <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/articles/assert-good-or-evil/noQuote-vs-singleQuote.php">no quote vs single quote</a> test, there is a 25% reduction in speed once assertion checking is turned off when you use single-quotes.</p>

<p>Back to the results quoted above, the next thing that's interesting with this is the execution of my_assert().  This shows the difference in executing compiled code versus parsed code.  assert(), even with the extra things it has to check, runs faster than straight PHP because it's compiled.</p>

<!--nextpage-->
<h3>Real world examples</h3>

<p>This is fine, but we need to know what happens in real world examples.  The most common reason to need to force a particular type of value is SQL queries.  The one you see the most is a query to make sure that an ID is an integer.  Generally, the code goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>$sql = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = " . intval($_GET['id']);</code></p></blockquote>

<p>This works fine, until someone tries to insert something malicious via get[id], at which time your query returns an empty rowset.  This isn't a problem, unless you want to know it is going to fail prior to even sending the query.</p>

<p>To do this, you have to implement an if() to insure that intval($_GET['id']) is going to return a greater than zero integer, or better yet, that intval($_GET['id']) == $_GET['id'].  Remember, PHP does not force typing and will attempt to convert types to make a best guess match.  The string "1" and the integer 1 will both match each other.</p>

<p>So with this in hand, let's try running the assert(), and making sure that whatever is inserted into the query is an integer.  Since we're looking at best practices, I'm going to test two methods of creating the query: the standard of adding it dynamically to the string, and the non-standard, but one I favor, where we use sprintf() to handle the type-casting.</p>

<p>Here's what the three blocks of code we're testing:</p>

<blockquote><p><code><br />
// Dynamically change<br />
assert($i == intval($i));<br />
$sql = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = " . intval($i);<br />
<br />
// Re-assign at the start<br />
assert($i == intval($i));<br />
$i = intval($i);<br />
$sql = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = " . $i;<br />
<br />
// Filter via sprintf()<br />
assert($i == intval($i));<br />
$sql = sprintf("SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = %d", $i);</code></p></blockquote>

<p>The results from <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/articles/assert-good-or-evil/realWorldAssert.php">this test</a> are a lot closer, but something interesting happened when I ran the code the second time:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>First run</em><br />
Dynamic change: 1000000 times took 5.001196<br />
Re-assign: 1000000 times took 5.499048<br />
sprintf(): 1000000 times took 4.669491</p>

<p><em>Second run (immediately after)</em><br />
Dynamic change: 1000000 times took 4.099901<br />
Re-assign: 1000000 times took 4.599407<br />
sprintf(): 1000000 times took 4.644968</p></blockquote>

<p>PHP caches the results from the first run, and using straight PHP runs faster.  After looking at these results, we can see that re-assigning $i in the second block makes no sense.  Now the question comes down to using a dynamic string, or sprintf().  If every fraction of second counts for your code, I would say use the first where $i is converted at the last second.  If being able to duplicate your codes execution time or readability is important, use sprintf().  </p>

<p>Again, this shows that execution of the compiled parts of PHP are much more predictable.  In the second run, sprintf() only gained .02 seconds, while the using the string gained a full second, or 20%!  </p>

<p>(note: After the 2 or 3 minutes it took to write these few paragraphs after the tests, I re-ran the benchmark code.  sprintf() was still at 4.64x, while the other two had both move up to 4.1x and 4.6x respectively.)</p>

<!--nextpage-->
<h3>Comparing assert() to other solutions</h3>

<p>I've settled on sprintf() being the way to handle changing types.  It keeps everything clean, and insures that the value I'm working with is in the original format that it was passed in as.  This is a personal call that you will have to make for your code.</p>

<p>Now the thing to determine is how to implement error checking.  In order for it to be useful, we'll need a means of turning it off.  assert_options() provides us with a standard way of turning things off so we'll work under the assumption that if assert()s are disabled, we won't perform our error checking.  There are three ways to check that our $i value is a valid integer, or capable of becoming one without losing data.</p>

<ul><li>assert()</li>
<li>check_int()</li>
<li>hard coded if()</li></ul>

<p>There is a forth way.  You could implement check_int_strict() which will insure that the value is an integer to begin with, but that removes the ability to convert strings dynamically to an integer, so I haven't included that here.</p>

<p>Here's the results from our <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/articles/assert-good-or-evil/realWorldAssert2.php">final test</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Straight assert using sprintf: 1000000 times took 4.502889<br />
Using check_int(): 1000000 times took 5.623649<br />
Using hard coded checking: 1000000 times took 4.234395</p></blockquote>

<p>As our first test showed, using custom methods isn't really the best solution; compiled code runs faster than parsed code.  The first and last are remarkably close.  Again, the more simple the code is, the faster it runs: if() as a control structure runs faster than assert() as a function.</p>

<p>This test does leave one crucial part out, however.  In my test, assert() accounts for one line and the if() accounts for three lines that are iterated over.  In a real-world implementation where there was 1 million asserts to run (a stretch, to be sure, but I guess it could happen), it would account for 1 million lines of code.  The if() statement which now only accounts for 3 lines would balloon to 3 million lines of code in production.  Any gain in execution speed from using if() instead of assert() would probably be knocked out by the 3-fold increase in filesize.</p>

<!--nextpage-->
<h3>In closing</h3>
<p>So is assert() good or evil?  Well, in some uses it can really slow down your code.  Something I had done out of habit, using single-quotes, can take up time that is not necessary if you intend to leave assert()'s turned on in the production version of your code.</p>

<p>As for their general use, its a personal choice.  Personally, I'll continue to use them coupled with sprintf().  It simplifies the code to have a series of assert() calls at the top of a method so future developers can see immediately what is expected.</p>

<p>With all good tools, there is a time and a place to use them.  They should not be used to control how a method behaves.  To quote from the PHP manual:</p>

<blockquote><p>Assertions should be used as a debugging feature only. You may use them for sanity-checks that test for conditions that should always be <strong>TRUE</strong> and that indicate some programming errors if not or to check for the presence of certain features like extension functions or certain system limits and features.</p></blockquote>

<p>If a method can run when a something evaluates to false, you don't want to use an assert().  In other words, if an assert() fails it should be a show stopper.</p>

<p>Hope some of you have found this interesting...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Surely a two hour flight between Phoenix and KC isn't enough for jet lag...?  It probably has more to do with the 1:30'ish AM arrival at KCI.  Yeah, that's the last time I think "oh, it's only midnight, that's not too bad."  Apparently, in the time it took for me to check my luggage and walk to my gate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon">monsoon</a> storm come up that was bad enough to stop all incoming traffic for about an hour.  I knew I was in for a long night when they announce about 10 minutes before my plane was supposed to arrive "flight ####, the plane going to Kansas City is now in the air and should be here in time for an 8:13 departure."  I believe it was closer to night <abbr title="Mountain Standard Time">MST</abbr> before we actually took off.</p>

<p>Anyhow... I'm still beat even with a lot of sleep.</p>

<p>In other news - talk about a lackluster lead-in - I'm bidding adieu to Kansas City.  I haven't landed on a specific date, but I'm looking at some time over the next month or two.  KC has been great to me, but I've got sand in my blood and I've got an opporunity to head out <a href="http://phoenix.gov/">Phoenix</a> way.  I'm not sure that I'll end up in Phoenix proper, some place like <a href="http://www.flagstaff.az.gov/">Flagstaff</a> might be fun.</p>

<p>These are the "<em>minor</em>" details I'll be working out over the coming weeks.  I'm probably going to make at least one more trip out there before I move to get a place lined up.  This next trip will probably be with bike in hand.  This past weekend, I kept thinking how much fun this road would be on a road bike, or that trail on a mountain bike, etc., etc.  It was hard to see sand and rocks and real climbs for the first time in over a year and a half and not be able to take advantage of it.</p>

There's some sweet <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/phoenix-from-july-30-31_photo-dump/dsc05228">looking singletrack</a> there, but unfortunately I don't have any of my bikes with me.

We are fighting a massive disinformation program from the left. They are losing their control over the mainstream media but are trying to keep control over information disseminated over the internet. The United States is fighting a real hot war against Islamo-facists for our very survival and unfortunately they are receiving aid and comfort by the left.Dont let the left stop you.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I normally don't quote <a href="">Fired Up</a>.  Roy's great, but sometimes his bias is almost too overwhelming - and this is coming from someone who agrees with most of what he has to say.  Anyway, <a href="">this post on the Medicaid cuts</a> really got my attention.    Here's the highlights from a memo he quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>As we implement Medicaid changes required by Senate Bill 539 and House Bill 11, we continue to receive concerns from legislators about clients who call them about the changes.... While any citizen may feel free to call their legislator, it is inappropriate for staff to make this type of referral in response to questions about the client?s eligibility.... With legislative work complete, a legislator is not able, at this time, to change the law or the budget that resulted in the specific change.  Thus, referring to a legislator may only result in <em>frustration for everyone</em>. (emphasis mine, <a href="http://www.firedupmissouri.com/gagorder">full version</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Umm... Yeah, we should <strong>never</strong> have state employees saying, "Hey, I just enforce the rules, if you don't like 'em here's who you should call to get them changed."  I really feel sorry for those poor, blessed souls in Jeff City.  They're just twiddling their thumbs, not able to do a damn thing like making and changing laws.  And it's just so <em>frustrating</em> to have to deal with the people who "elected" you.  I mean they didn't even vote last time around, and now they think they have the right to call and complain that you're not doing a good job representing them.  The gaul of those complainers.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://www.ascottmcculloch.com/wp/">Scott McCulloch's blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>WE BELIEVE that in the best American tradition of helping others help themselves, now is the time to join with other countries in a historic pact for compassion and justice to help the poorest people of the world overcome AIDS and extreme poverty.... <em>WE COMMIT ourselves - one person, one voice, one vote at a time - to make a better, safer world for all</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not generally up on celebrity causes, but this one (pardon the pun) looks like it has potential.  If they really mean what they're saying...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sun.com/one/">commercial</a> (being hosted by <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>) is great.  It's the first commerical Al Pacino has ever done and is up for <a href="http://politicaltechnology.com/one/blogs/one_blog/archive/2005/07/14/1656.aspx">an Emmy too</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't done one of my Google posts in awhile.  I've got some good ones today though.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=striving%20to%20attain%20a%20oneness%20in%20Christ">striving to attain a oneness in Christ</a> - I guess someone was trying to figure out how to be a Christian.

I guess someone was looking to vent...  If you come back anonymous Mac user, feel free to explain why running a restaurant with your dad sticks.</li></ul>

<p>Of course, there's also the standard "cycling legs", "cycling shaved legs", "Rick Mathes", etc., that I get a ton of.</p>

<p>In another Google area, my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/18/what_s_my_google_number">Google number</a> is still climbing.  I'm at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">13,100</a> currently.  Several thousand of those are because of my involvement in <a href="http://b2evolution.net">b2evolution.net</a>, however; there's a link to my site on the default installation.

        <title>Mailman - oh the pain...</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/07/14/mailman_oh_the_pain/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/07/14/mailman_oh_the_pain</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok... I love a good mailing list as much as the next nerd, but come on people.  Mailman is a pain in the butt to setup.  It took me nearly an hour to <a href="http://wiki.travisswicegood.com/index.php/Forward_qmail_message_to_mailman">remember how to set it up with qmail</a>...  I had everything I needed right in front of me, if only I had been turned around.  Then, it took me just as long to find out fix_url was actually the script I needed to move the domain name one of my lists was listed on.  I swear, the dozen other times I listed /home/mailman/bin it wasn't there.  My server has a gnome on it that's moving files around on me...</p>

<p>Long story short... I finally have mailman setup.  After having it running on my server for nearly half a year, I can actually say "it's ready".  If you're of the programmer type, you might find some of the lists interesting.  They're all very low traffic right now (some of them being just me on the list), but they'll get bigger now that the rest of the world knows about them.  So where are they?  <a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo">Right here</a>, of course.</p>

<p>Quick break down:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo/d51toolkit-dev">d51toolkit-dev</a> will be about <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/d51Toolkit/">d51Toolkit</a> development</li>
<li><a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo/phpcr-dev">phpcr-dev</a> is about <a href="http://www.phpcr.org/">phpCR</a> development</li>
<li>and finally <a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo/scribbleforge-dev">scribbleforge-dev</a> is for <a href="http://www.scribbleforge.com/">Scribble Forge</a> development</li></ul>

        <updated>2005-07-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/07/14/civil_liberties</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been meaning to post on this for a few days, but <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/1984.php">this post</a> from <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a> finally reminded me about it when I had a few free minutes.</p>

<p>Look for intensified Patriot 2 efforts in the US.  Watch the EU and/or individual countries in Europe to start strengthening their position.  Now governments have a "see, this <em>is</em> a war" excuse to remove our rights for the purpose of safety.</p>

<p>Dubya claims that the world is a safer place... Prove it to us.  Let the Patriot Act expire.  If the world is so much safer, there's no need for the government to have such broad power.</p>

<p>Now on to the conspiracy theorist in me...  Wasn't Tony Blair's responses rather lackadaisical?  It seemed to me that this was something he already knew was going to happen.  I'm not saying he put everything in place to make it happen or allowed it to happen, but if there was a vague threat that something was coming down but they couldn't pin-point it, might he have opted for silence instead of inciting public panic with "possibilities"?  If he had, it might have thwarted the effort at which time the government would have lost credibility.  It's a catch-22...</p>

<p>But... if they err on the side of an attack, it renews popularity and gives them free reign again to reign in our liberties.  Collateral damage isn't limited to "over there" any more.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow... I've had a dozen things I've wanted to post about, but just no time.  I've got five minutes right now while my computer at work finishes downloading the most recent updates.  Hard drive went out the midddle of last week and I've just got it back up and running today.</p>

<p>Seems like I just haven't had much time for anything.  I kicked around the idea of doing a new <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/tdf2004/">Tour de France Blog</a>, but I'm not going to be able to devote as much time to it this year as I did last.  You'll have to rely on sites like <a href="http://www.tdfblog.com/">TDFBlog.com</a> and others for their excellent coverage.</p>

<p>There's a lot going on right now - unfortunately that's about all I can say.  Kind of stinks being someone who supports openness - open source, open government - but right now is not the time.  It is the place, just not yet...</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'll try to keep something on the site from time to time... 30 seconds to go.  Timed that perfect.</p>

        <title>On Progress (or: I want to cry)</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/06/16/on_progress_or_i_want_to_cry/"/>
        <updated>2005-06-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/06/16/on_progress_or_i_want_to_cry</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I toured progress tonight.  I saw squirrels doing their thing; heard birds chirping as the evening turned to dusk; and listened to insects and frogs herald the beginning of the night... and now I want to cry.</p>

<p>A hawk flew from his perch; angry that I had encroached on his hunting grounds.  I felt as though I should apologize, but his lonely call told me what I needed to know.  I could hear him curse me for giving him this barren wasteland in place of the forest he once lorded over.</p>

<p>As I crested a hill that once contained a path leading down to a natural creek crossing, I felt a lump in my throat.  Below me was a mound of black ash with a few small piles of ash still smoking though the fire had been extinguished for weeks.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill meandered the remnants of a creek as if trying to scream "I <strong>am</strong> still here".  It reminded me of a prize fighter in the 10th round.  Obvious to everyone that he is done, he still pulls himself up off the mat one last time damned to give up if he can still stand.</p>

<p>Across the newly created valley cavity, on top of the hill north of me was a freshly smoldering fire pit.  Smoke slowly drifted from the hole in the ground offering evidence that it had consumed its surroundings.  The irony struck me: has the city on the hill now burned out its light and started to consume itself?</p>

<p>As I toured the scene of carnage, I wondered to myself what the people who did this were like.  Not the owners of the land that will profit off of the new development, but the guys and gals who ran the equipment and lit the fires.  Had they walked the paths that criss-crossed the woods before they tore them down?  Did this bother them?  Had the lottery of birth landed them in a life where this was the only way they saw to make ends meet, or was this work a conscious choice?  ... Did they even care?</p>

<p>I feel horrible.  I participate in this.  I may not run the bulldozer, but I live where forest was just a handful of years ago.  How can I condemn what I have benefited from?</p>

<p>My despair was lifted as I made my way back home.  I passed a small pond in the development where I live and watched two geese and their younglings paddle away from the side as I approached and was reminded life goes on.  No matter what we do, life will preserve itself.  We may pass, but the force that started all of this will continue with or without us to observe it.  I just wish we could do our part to contribute to it instead of taking so much.</p>

<p>So, I'm cleaning it out.  This huge list of people that are constantly going on and offline is taking up screen real estate and serving as a destraction.  I'm not going to do a full removal of everybody, but if I don't remember what face/name goes with the screen name or the time that's elapsed since we last chatted is counted in years, you're probably going to get cut.  If you're afraid you might not make the cut and want to stay on my buddy list, show me an <a href="aim:goim?screenname=tswicego&amp;message=Hi.+Are+you+there?">im</a> and let me know.</p>

Ok, ok - so the last one is wishful thinking on my part, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>You know how sometimes you say it to the wrong person or say it out loud and the barrier you had is almost instantly removed (instantly being in geological time)?  Sort of like the gods saying "Check.  Your move."  Almost a dare if you will.  Well, I had one of those today.  I'll elaborate more as everything gets worked out, but it could mean big changes at Casa del Travisimo.</p>

There have been a <a href="http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/?q=node/view/198">few</a> <a href="http://sourcelabs.com/ajb/archives/2005/05/ajax_mistakes.html">people</a> who <strike>genuinely don't seem to care for it</strike> <em>consider it a potential liability due to its intricacies</em>, but today is the first time I read a post that I agreed with 100%.  <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/">Marcus Baker</a> of <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> made some observations.  In <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/blog/index.php?p=19">his post</a> he argues that most of the uses are actually going against learned behavior.  To boil his case down, he's pointing out that AJAX is great in environments where you're striking out in new territory or where you're trying to mock existing behavior (moving from a desktop app to a web app for example), but to use AJAX for the sake of using AJAX defeats its usefulness.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/blog/index.php?p=19">post</a> is definitely worth the read if you're interested in AJAX and how it can be used.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For all of you who can't get enough about me, I am now running a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Awiki">wiki</a> at <a href="http://wiki.travisswicegood.com">wiki.travisswicegood.com</a>.  </p>

<p>This will become a repository of information that I collect that is better presented in a structured way instead of in reverse chronological order.  One thing I hope to work on moving soon are all of my <a href="http://wiki.travisswicegood.com/index.php/Reading_Notes">reading notes</a>.  They will make much more sense presented in a wiki format than a blog.</p>

<p>As you might notice, there's no way for you to edit my wiki.  Unlike public wikis such as <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, my wiki is going to be closed.  I may open up an editor account to allow a few friends and family to help edit out the typos I'm sure to put on it, but other than that it will remained closed.</p>

<p>Anyhow, enough writing... time for my beauty rest. :)</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/23/a_more_perfect_union</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<fieldset><legend>Author's note</legend>This is in response to a <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/infocities/blogs/index.php?blog=26&amp;title=practicing_a_disassociative_dysfunctiona&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1#c93">comment</a> I left on Vlad's site last week.  After polishing this up throughout the day, I thought I'd share it here.  You're jumping in in the middle of the conversation, so you might want to <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/infocities/blogs/index.php?blog=26&amp;title=practicing_a_disassociative_dysfunctiona&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">catch up</a>.</fieldset>
<blockquote><p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a <em>more perfect Union</em>, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not saying that it has lived up to the standards it has set for itself, but it seems to provide the frame work.</p>

<p>To me, the police are controllable so long as they are not autonomous.  In most cities, the police chief answers to the mayor and city council who <em>should</em> answer to the people.  Things get murky when the elected official start answering to those other than their electorate<sup>1</sup>.  In walks Mr. ", Inc.".</p>

<p>Big businesses who are outside the control of government (and thus the people) are the largest threat.  It's at their behest that the war, current repeals of social services, etc., are being done.  The one thing that no one's touched on (that I've seen anyway) is that the crown jewel that Dubya has been pushing over the last few months, SS privatization, is nothing more than corporate welfare.  That money is going to be invested in corporate America.  They see this SS money as nothing more than a big honey pot that they can't wait to get their hands on.  In a world where corporations were benevolent - which is almost an oxymoron, but bare with me - this wouldn't be a problem, but look what people's faith in this scum suckers (I know, I'm generalizing here) has done in over the last few years.</p>

<p>Which, as best as I can figure, is where you're going with this.  You see the undo influence that Mr. Inc. holds over the system and the corrosive effect it's having.  But to remove government as a whole seems to be throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>

<p>The answer seems to me - and I'll admit, I've only recently started thing on this - requires a fundamental shift in paradigm regarding corporations.  Currently, they have run amuck.  We need to reel them in, realizing that the only reason they exist is because "we, the people", have granted them the right to.  They don't have an inalienable right to exist, contrary to current Supreme Court rulings.  Because of their special status, they should answer to a greater good.  This is what corporations were originally intended for.</p>

<p>But I don't see this happening any time soon.  The main reason is apathy.  If people were more than sheep, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in.  Of course, when you have corporations with a vested self-interest in the status-quo that own the media which disseminates the information to the people, it's easier to breed apathy if that's your aim.  So it's the people's fault, but the corporations are doing their part to make sure the people screw it up...  A circular argument, I know, but the best I can muster right now.</p>

<p>Your turn... :)</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<ol><li><a name="footnote-1"></a>By electorate, I am referring to actual citizens with voting power.  Given the current legal status of a corporation, it could be argued that they are also part of the electorate as they are guaranteed certain rights, but I am purposefully excluding them.</li>

        <title>Weekend in the Ozarks</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/22/weekend_in_the_ozarks/"/>
        <updated>2005-05-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/22/weekend_in_the_ozarks</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nothing like doing something productive on the weekend.  I spent the better part of mine with the <a href="http://www.earthriders.org/">guys from ERTA</a> working on the <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewforum.php?f=18">trails at Lake of the Ozarks State Park (LoSP)</a>.  We still haven't got to benchcut the trails, we're still in a clearing mode.  Doug lead a few guy in building some creek crossings - and even managed to get one or two on the trail.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define:naturalist">naturalist</a> of the state park doesn't want anyone riding the trail until it is "completed" and because she doesn't know what she's doing.  Trails need to be ridden in before they're finished so you can make sure you're building them in the right place. There were a few sections that I - err, I mean if I had been riding I would have seen needed to be moved about 6" - 12" to one side or the other to make sure follow the natural flow of the trail.  Since we're <em>not</em> riding the trails though it would be almost impossible to figure out that they were just a bit off. ;)</p>

<p>I've got some pictures of the trails that we were working on; I'll post 'em tomorrow.  I think the trails going to be killer once they're completed.  Talking with Posson, he's figuring on finishing it up sometime this fall or during the winter.  This means next year it'll be a great weekend destination for riding.</p>

<p>If you haven't had the opportunity to hang out with the guys from ER/ERTA, you've got to put it on your to-do list.  Saturday night's dinner was a riot.  Nothing like going into a family run restaurant when half of the family is <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/threesheetst.html">three sheets to the wind</a> and the other is sufferring a family crisis and trying to "manage" the drunken half of her family.  Throw in nine rowdy guys and you can imagine the fun that ensued.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm nearly three days behind on any personal correspondences now so if I owe you an email, know that you should be hearing from me you soon.  Also, on the ride down I had a very thought provoking few hours of conversation which has given me some fodder for writing.  Once I get a chance to hash out my thoughts, I'll post 'em.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well - today was productive for me.  Got a lot of work done, finished up the first stage of a really cool creek crossing at the <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/trails/trail.php?s=mo&amp;file=smithville.xml">Smithville Trails</a> in and managed to commute to work via bike today.  Got a little over an hour and a half in on the bike.  It's the first time I've ridden my bike in to work in nearly two years, and it felt great.  This week is the <a href="http://www.marc.org/bcc/">Bicycle Commmuter Challenge</a> and I'm participating.  I don't think I'm going to get to ride every day, but I'll be getting in at least three days.  I generally spend 50 - 60 minutes a day in my car driving back and forth, so for only 40 minutes more I get to ride my bike.  A great trade-off because it should help me get my racing legs back under me.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/15/my_body_hates_mes</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, all day - except while I took a nap - my body has been screaming at me.  It's acting like a toddler who isn't getting the toy they want at Toys 'R' Us.  I can't really blame it, yesterday was a torture-a-thon.</p>

<p>Started out a bit early for me on a Saturday.  At 7 I was up and getting ready to go to the <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/trails/trail.php?s=mo&amp;file=smithville.xml">Smithville Trails</a> for some trail work.  This week, <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/">Earthriders</a> is having their monthly meeting up there, so we're in the process of sprucing the trails up for everyone.  One of the things that I've been wanting to do is build a solid rock trail crossing on one of the places that constantly has water issues.  With the help of my Dad, I just about got it in yesterday...  He's amazingly helpful when the alternative is helping my Mom clean out the garage :D</p>

<p>Spending half a day positioning 50 - 100 pound rocks is enough for anybody, but not me.  I followed this up with a 2 hour <a href="http://www.acmebicyclecompany.com/tourdecowtown.htm">alley cat race</a>.  I managed to stay out of the top ten (mainly because 5 of the restaurants I stopped at for take-out menus didn't have any, but I'm not bitter!) in the race, and managed to pull the slowest time in the time trial.  Note to self: work on balancing things on your back and handlebars before the next alley cat.  What can I say, though?  I have a string of last place finishes I needed to defend :)</p>

<p>If you're interested, I have some <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat">pictures up on MeAndTravis</a>.  A few local blogger/cyclists were represented: <a href="http://staubio.blogspot.com/">Stuabio</a> <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04743">tries to look mean</a>, and <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/infocities/blogs/index.php?blog=26">Vlad</a> <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04733">pulls off the mean look</a>, and I look goofy <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04853">trying to ride a chopper</a>.  And of course, what race would be complete without some <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04840">road rash</a>?</p>

<p>If that wasn't enough punishment for my body, I headed out to a wedding reception 'til 1.  No biggie, except I'm normally be bed by 11 (I'm a barrel of monkey's worth of fun, really!).  So now my body's screaming at me.  Hopefully it'll be better by tomorrow.  I'll be <a href="http://www.marc.org/bcc/">commuting by bike</a> in to work, so if nothing else I'll give it a few more reasons to be pissed.</p>

        <title>Freakonomics, Chapter 4: Where have all the criminals gone?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/13/freakonomics_chapter_4_where_have_all_th/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/13/freakonomics_chapter_4_where_have_all_th</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This chapter is bound to drawn some interest.  Levitt and Dubner explore whether abortion has anything to do with the drop in crime a generation after it was legalized.</p>
<!--more-->
<ul><li>"Of all of the Communist leaders deposed in the years bracketing the collapse of the Soviet Union, only Nicolae Ceausescu met a violent death.  It should not be overlooked that his demise was precipitated in large measure by the youth of Romania - a great number of whom, were it not for his abortion ban, would never have been born at all." - page 119</li>
<li>Discussing how some experts miss the forest for the trees: "The mayor of a city sees that his citizens celebrate wildly when their team wins the World Series.... So the following year, the mayor decrees that his citizens start celebrating the World Series <em>before the first pitch is thrown</em> - an act that, in his confused mind, will ensure victory." - page 123</li>
<li>Isaac Ehrlich wrote a paper in 1975 which is often used as the "proof" that the death penalty works.  According to his paper, 1 execution saves 7 lives. - page 125</li>
<li>In talking about the idea that "innovative policing strategies" lead to a decrease in crime: "This theory rapidly became an article of faith because it appealed to the factors that, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a>, most contribute to the formation of conventional wisdom: the ease with which an idea may be understood and the degree to which it affects our personal well-being."</li>
<li>In talking about the effect of gun buyback programs and their effect on homicide: "Given the number of handguns in the United States and the number of homicides each year, the likelihood that a particular gun was used to kill someone that year in 1 in 10,000.  The typical gun buyback program yields fewer than 1,000 guns - which translates into an expectation of less than one-tenth of one homicide per buyback." - page 133</li>
<li>"The typical crack murder involved one crack dealer shooting another (or two of them, or three) and not, contrary to <em>conventional wisdom</em>, some bug-eyed crackhead shooting a shopkeeper over a few dollars" - page 134, emphesis mine</li>
<li>"Another minor contributor to the falling homicide rate [among those likely to be crack dealers] is the fact that some crack dealers took to shooting their enemies in the buttocks rather than murdering them; this method ofviolent insult was considered more degrading - and was obviously less severely punished - than murder." - page 135</li>
<li>"In the early days of the [United States], it was permissible to have an abortion prior to "quickening" - that is, when the first movements of the fetus could be felt..." - page 137 - that's an interesting tidbit you don't hear/read every day.</li>
<li>"Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime.  This theory is bound to provide a variety of reactions, ranging from disbelief to revulsion, and a variety of objections, ranging from the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=quotidian">quotidian</a> to the moral." - page 139</li>
<li>"But when it comes to cause and effect, there is often a trap in ... open-and-shut thinking.... We too embrace faulty causes, usually at the urging of an expert proclaiming a truth in which he has a vested interest." - page 140</li>
<li>"What the link between abortion and crime does say is this: when the government gives a woman the opportunity to make her own decision about abortion, she generally does a good job of figuring out if she is in a position to raise the baby well." - page 144</li></ul>

<p>How's that for an introduction to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/006073132X/ref=pd_wt_1?coliid=I2X651R8O5EOA">Freakonomics</a>?  This is definitely one of the more provocative books I've read in awhile.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just "discovered" <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/14676/">Upcoming.org</a> today.  I've known about it for some time, but I never really spent any time exploring it.  I've gone about adding all sorts of events to the <a href="http://upcoming.org/metro/us/mo/kc/">Kansas City metro</a>.  </p>

<p>If you pay any attention to the column on the right side of my web site, you'll see a new "<em>upcoming in kc</em>" section - that's being generated by entries on Upcoming.  So go <a href="http://upcoming.org/register/">sign-up</a> for an account and <a href="http://upcoming.org/add/event/89/">add the events</a> you know about.  With enough people adding an event or two a week, we could have all of the goings on in Kansas City covered.</p>

<p>Oh - and if you'd like to display what's "upcoming in kc" on your site, just leave a comment and I'll send you the code.  Right now it requires a bit of technical know-how to make it happen, but if there's enough interest I could make a widget that you could just copy and paste into your site.</p>

        <title>Reading Notes: Chapter 5 - A Puzzle and an Overview</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently, my prior reading notes are quite popular with search engine goers, so I'm going to start trying to keep more notes online in the hopes that some of my random visitors will find them useful.  I'll try to preface all of these posts with some warning in case reading chapter-by-chapter notes on books of odd-interests sounds like a boring way to spend your blog surfing time.</p>

<p>These are from a book I've been working on half-heartedly for about 4 months now.  I recently pulled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0465083323/qid=1115956340/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">The Second Bill of Rights</a> off of my bookshelf and have been working on it again.  It's an interesting book, but the author's writing style leaves a lot to be desired (but I'll come back to that... as <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/">Sunstein</a> might say).</p>
<!--more-->
<ul><li>In 1950 the General Assembly at the UN asked the Comission on Human Rights to make a single document that encapsulated all human rights - political, social, and economic.  The result was two documents: the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm">International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.  The former has been adopted by 147 nations, the latter by 142 of the 147.  The abstaining nations: Botswana, Haiti, Mozambique, South Africa, and the United States.</a></li>
<li>with an English common law background are far less likely to contain social and economic rights than those with a French civil law background." - page 105</li>
<li>In describing why America might lack a social bill of rights: "<em>American exceptionalism</em>: the absense of a significant socialist or even a social democratic movement in the United States." - page 106</li>
<li>"As we shall see, in the 1960s the Supreme Court..." - page 106 - <em>my note: don't tell me what I'm going to be reading about - get to the point and tell me about it.  That's what the comment in the opening of these notes were about.</em></li>
<li>"... in the 1968 election, as Richard M. Nixon narrowly defeated Hubert Humphrey.  Nixon won with 43.6 percent of the popular vote to Humphrey's 42.6 percent.  President Nixon appointed four justices who promptly reversed the emerging trend, insisting that the Constitution does not include social and economic guarantees." - page 108 - <em>That's the answer to what happened in the '60s.</em></li></ul><p>t last note - it'll be interesting to see what tectonic shifts maintain their momentum out of Bush's narrow victory margins.</p>

        <updated>2005-05-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/11/movies_movies_movies</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I picked up a <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> membership about a month ago, so I've watched more movies the last month than I probably have in the last.  I've been meaning to post some reviews of them, but just haven't got around to it.  Three have stuck out as worth noting.  <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/sideways/">Sideways</a>, <a href="http://www.whatthebleep.com/">What the Bleep Do We Know?</a>, and one I finally watched tonight, <a href="http://www.thecorporation.com/">The Corporation</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First off, <em>Sideways</em>.  I personally think it was a few minor things away from being a best picture at the <a href="http://www.oscars.org/index.html">Academy</a> Watch the highway scene toward the beginning to see what I'm talking about - ever see someone do 20 mph down the freeway?</p>

<p><em>What the Bleep</em> was a kooky movie.  It's hard to define.  Sort of a documentary; sort of a movie - though sort on scenes.  Throw in the occasional animated scenes and you've got an idea what it is.  The premise very new age: quantum physics can be used to explain what's going on on a larger scale.  Through our own self-determination, we can create the instance of the world we live in.  Looked at through the lens of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0735202850/qid=1115865084/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Psycho-Cybernetics</a> it makes perfect sense.  Of course, it's all theoretical, but it raises some interest points to ponder.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>The Corporation</em>.  What can I say?  Great topic, needed to be told, etc., etc.  It was kind of drawn out though.  Two hours and twenty-two minutes?  The people who need to hear this movie's message aren't going to sit that long without something going on.  There was one great story from it though.  I'll paraphrase it here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Think of when man was first trying to fly.  One guy would strap wings to his arms and run off the edge of a cliff, flapping his wings for all he has.  He's flying - or that's the way he sees it.  And he'll continue to "fly" until he runs out of air and discovers the stopping properties of the ground.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can't help but think of thoughts like <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewtopic.php?p=3921#3921">this one</a> when I read that.  Some people honestly think that we can fly, so they consume, consume, consume... sure that the market - the creation of the modern era - will save them.  Makes me feel sorry for our collective state.  That was actually the overpowering feeling of <em>The Corporation</em> - depression.  It was a depressing movie, but worth the watch if you want to wallow in the corporate future we have to look forward to if we keep moving in the direction we're headed.</p>

        <title>First Fridays May 2005 Recap</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm back from <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php?cat=75">First Fridays</a> tonight.  I don't feel like I know <em>that</em> many people in Kansas City, but I couldn't go 15 or 20 minutes without running into someone I knew.  Weird how that works.</p>

<p>Anyhow, tonight was by far the best First Friday of the year.  When I got back to my car at 9:30, the tempature was still 75!  It was perfect weather.  I took a <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/kansas-city-first-fridays-may-2005-raw">ton of pictures</a>.  I'm uploading the 244 pictures I took between 5 and the time my battery finally ran out about 8:45.  These are all raw images with no post-production on them, so keep that in mind.  If I get the time over the weekend, I'll finish some of them up.  There's also going to be a ton of pictures of the same people (probably the first 60 or 70).  It was <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/kansas-city-first-fridays-may-2005-raw/DSC04367">Judy's</a> birthday, so I hung out with them and took a lot of pictures before venturing forth to the rest of the festivities.</p>

<p>Also, if you're looking for some good, cheap pizza afterwards, check out Grinders (sorry, no site).  They'll be open until 2 and the kitchens working the whole night!</p>

<p>Keep your eyes peeled for me.  I'll be roaming around tonight.  Since you know what I look like, grab me and say hi!</p>

        <title>A new Mac in my future?</title>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/05/a_new_mac_in_my_future</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about buying a new computer.  I already have a handful of Linux machines, and one that I can boot into Windows XP Pro whenever I need a slow, unreliable system, so I was thinking about giving a Mac a try.  It's the one operating system that I'm not comfortable in doing day-to-day stuff in.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm clueless as to what to look for in a Mac.  I'm trying to decide between an iBook/PowerBook and a mini-Mac.  I may use it some for a little bit of programming and design, otherwise it would be used for Internet stuff and video/photo editing.  I can handle most of my photo editing in the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, but video editing in Linux is more trouble than it should be.</p>

<p>I know some of my readers are Macites (or something along those lines) and would appreciate any feedback you can offer.  Moving from a PC to Mac, what are the things that differ that I need to look at?  Are there any specs I should keep an eye on?</p>

        <title>Experimenting with speed</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/04/experimenting_with_speed/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/05/04/experimenting_with_speed</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last three days, I've been experimenting with speed with some great results that I wanted to share here.  </p>

<p>Talk about a lead in.  :)  No, it's not <em>that</em> kind of speed, but my car's speed.  I've been driving the speed limit in to and back home from work.  Since I am the slowest car on the road, I can set my cruise and go to town - literally.  Coming in to work today with a bike on top of my car, I got nearly 40 mpg!</p>

<p>It's interesting how many cars speed.  I was passed by two school buses this morning while I was driving the speed limit.  School buses people!  When our school buses don't pay any attention to laws, what has the world come to?</p>

<p>Oh, and as far as time...  I think it might take me a minute or two longer by dropping the extra 4 - 6 mph.  For that extra two minutes, I'm gaining more than 10% in fuel efficiency.  So do your part, try to plan your drives so you can do the speed limit.  It'll save you money and piss off everyone else on the road! :)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My placing didn't improve much, but at least this race didn't include a beer drinking intermission.  You know, seeing my comparative strength to the "real" experts out there, I spent a lot of time yesterday off the back of the pack wondering why I'm racing expert.  Right now, I'm a bona fide sport.  Probably not even a winning one.  So why am I torturing myself by going up against these guys?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm still not sure.  Had three hours to think about it yesterday on the drive home, and I'm just as clueless when I finish.  I did figure this out, though: my biggest obstacle to sticking with them right now doesn't have to do with my legs, or my fitness, or any other normal cycling quality.  It exists between my ears.</p>

<p>I keep defeating myself.  Yesterday, when I got off of the course I still had plenty of go in me.  Granted I did one less lap than I was anticipating, but I had more than four more miles of energy in me.  Right now I need to work on using up the energy store that I have available to me.  I keep holding back while I'm out there.  When you're doing the endurance races, that can be a good strategy, but not for something that's less than 2 hours.  It's balls to the wall the whole time, but I kept easing up.</p>

<p>So that's why I'm finishing so poorly.  I think.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be out there beating these guys if I had the write mental focus, but I definitely wouldn't be a lap off the pace.</p>

I know, I know... cheesy name, but I didn't name it.  The drive up to the race location - just south of Omaha - took me up I-29 through northwestern Missouri.  About 20 miles from the Iowa state line, I-29 gets out of the rolling hills and starts traveling along the side of the river bluffs.</p>

<p>It was something else to see how big of a swath the Missouri used to cut through that part of the country.  There were a few places where the bluffs were at least five miles apart.  Can you imagine a river swollen to five miles from side-to-side?  I guess it's the desert rat in me, but that's hard to comprehend.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/04/23/rogue_judges_scourge_of_the_earth</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>This is in response to <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewtopic.php?p=3127#3127">a post</a> on the Earthriders forum.  I thought it was good enough to share :)</fieldset>

<p>Wait just a minute... you mean legislators don't give fully weigh both solutions to a problem in a fair, non-partisan way prior to making choices that effect the lives of millions?  I'm devistated...</p>

<p>/end sarcasm :)</p>

<p>I agree with you basically, Rob, but I was sort of joking with the last post.  On <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">my site</a>, any controversial topic always denigrates into "but those rogue judges" as someone tries to defend an undefendable position.  Personally, I don't think there is such a thing.  I think there's judges that don't agree with people's ideological take on the law so they're "rogue" or "activist" or "leftist" or (loosely quoted from the Senate floor) "causing frustration that I can understand how might end in... (long pause for effect) ... violence".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've never heard of the idea that the government should be awarded the damages though.  Personally, I like a litigious society.  It keeps everyone in check.  If you do something to overtly to me, I want the right to take you to court, have our differences heard and receive some sort of restitution.  I think the bar is set a little too low in some cases.  Coffee has the ability to scald, and bikes can get you hurt.  If it's a mountain bike and you're using it as its designed, it will get you hurt... eventually.</p>

<p>My problem with a litigious society happens with special interests get control over the laws.  Right now (on in the very near future, if it hasn't taken effect yet), if I was medically qualified  surgeon and performed a surgery on someone and amputated the wrong arm, I would be held liable no more than $250,000 - I'm almost 100% this is the way it is in California now, and with the new medical malpractice reforms Congress passed this year it will be this way nationwide soon.  Now if I go hop on some file-sharing network and download two songs, I can be held liable for $300,000!  </p>

<p>Yeah... I see how that's right.  I'm a doctor, expected to make the right choices, but go get drunk and mutilate someone - a cool quarter of a million and we'll call it even.  But download a song!  Stop the presses we have a serial society destroyer on our hands!  Sue the teenager for everything they'll make for the first few decades of their life!  And if it is a pre-released song/video and the MPAA/RIAA has their way - <a href="http://news.com.com/Prison+terms+on+tap+for+prerelease+pirates/2100-1028_3-5677232.html?tag=st.prev">it's slammer time</a> for you!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it all comes down to money and I'm not sure how to remove that from the equation.  Politicians need money to run for office, so they're do fund raisers.  I don't think public funding is the answer.  I see it as a way for the two parties to lock themselves in.  How exactly can you trust them to come up with a fair and equitable way to distribute money to all of the candidates that might want to run?  Short answer is you can't.  They'll have the bar so high that only someone who financially independent (can anyone say "Forbes" and "Perot") or has a party machinery behind them will actually have the resources to meet their requirements (10k signatures in 10 different counties for state office, or some other ridiculous requirement).</p>

<p>And the infotainment world needs advertising revenue.  They aren't going to bite the hand that feeds them.  In some cases, it wouldn't be the hand that feeds them, but rather the hand that feeds them, provides a place for them to stay, and puts up with them.  What happened to anti-trust laws?  Oh that's right, we save those for companies that don't "really effect us" (a quote from a Senator when asked why the Justice department went after Microsoft but wouldn't pursue big oil for price fixing).</p>

<p>When I look through the history of the US, it seems to me that we're on a similar course as we were at the end of the 19th century.  Business is being given free reign, the government is their whore, and the major newspapers aren't doing a damn thing about.  Thank god we do have the new version of the independent press - the blog.</p>

<p>Hey, Rob, you left your soap box here... ;)</p>

        <title>On being a racing cyclist</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/04/22/on_being_a_racing_cyclist/"/>
        <updated>2005-04-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/04/22/on_being_a_racing_cyclist</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm reading what is turning out to be a great book from the UK called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841151041/qid=1114230700/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_0/026-8609296-2665256">The Escape Artist</a>; the memoirs of an amateur cyclist.  I haven't finished it, so I won't offer a full review of it yet, but I thought this paragraph from the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=prologue">Prologue</a> was worth sharing with you:</p>

<blockquote><p>A certain willed stupidity is useful to the cyclist - the type I was, a racing cyclist.  To train as hard as you must merely to be able to race, to reach the minimum standard of fitness and speed and stamina necessary even to finish a race, let alone to win a <em>place</em> in one, for that you need to acquire this willed stupidity.  The racing cyclist must be a Nietzschean hero without an idea in his head.  The goal, attainable by slow degrees, is to be fitter and faster, to be able to push on beyond those moments when the body is begging for respite.  To race well, you have to be willing to make whatever sacrifice is necessary to transcend yourself, again and again.  You have to push yourself and it has to hurt.  You have to put out of your mind the burning desire to stop by the side of the road and take a rest.  For the racing cyclist, there is always another hill, another sprint, another lap, another mile.  The dogged belief in your own perfectibility works like a drug; it makes you feel chosen to belong to an elite. - <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841151041/qid=1114230700/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_0/026-8609296-2665256">The Escape Artist</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>All I can say is wow...  If that and the first few chapters (or Stages) are any indicator, this will be one of the best books on cycling I've read.  I'll post more once I can make the decision though.</p>

<p>If you're curious as to what <em>willed stupidity</em> is, it was riding on the road tonight... solo.  It was a nice 65 degrees outside, with a 30 mph wind out of the north.  Winds out of the north here are always cold.  My guess is that the wind chill was somewhere in the upper 30s.  It took ten minutes of being inside before I could feel all of my toes after the ride tonight.  So what makes you want to freeze just to ride?  What makes riding into a wind so strong the voice in your head has to yell just to be heard <em>fun</em>?  What makes that a good way to spend a Friday evening?  A dogged belief in my own perfectibility...  It doesn't work like a drug, it is <em>the drug</em> and if you haven't partaken, you wouldn't understand.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Is a day off and a good massage.  I was on them or abusing them in some sort or another way too much this weekend.  Riding shoes aren't made for walking.  Read on and you'll see what I mean.</p>

<p>I spent this weekend driving to races and either patrolling or racing (if you call what I did "racing").  I'll tell ya, Experts are a class unto themselves.  It still amazes me to think I used to be able to at least keep them on the same lap, but I'll be there again.  I just need to spend some time on my bikes, which I'm working on.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, Saturday was the <a href="http://www.kccyclist.com/viewtopic.php?t=12">Crowderfest</a> "tour".  Any ride/tour/fun event that has a local pro show up becomes a race...  <a href="http://fisherbikes.com/team/rider_bio.asp?rider=chambers">Cameron Chambers</a> came to race.  He turned in a pretty impressive time at 4:26 for 100k (roughly 62.9 miles for my non-cyclist, American readers).  I was patrolling the race, so I couldn't give him a run for his money... yeah, that's it.  Since it was one big loop, I didn't get to participate much, but I did man the patrol tent all day and had fun almost catching a nap a few times.</p>

<p>On the way back - we caught sight of an only in Missouri scene.  On the side of I-35 - and remember, this is a major interstate highway - we saw a broke down car with a tractor pulled up beside it to help out.  I kid you not... Where else can you see that?  Well, maybe Kansas, but still... And people wonder why the midwest is called "fly-over country".  Maybe because AAA sends a tractor to help when your car breaks down!</p>

<p>Saturday was a slow day of preparation for <a href="http://www.kccyclist.com/viewtopic.php?t=4">Sunday's race</a> in Neosho, Missouri.  I drove down early and got there with plenty of time for a pre-ride... Well, I <em>would</em> have had time, but I broke my chain at what ended up being about the 60% point of the course.  I got back 20 minutes before my race started.  If you're not familiar with bike riding shoes, they're made to walk about as much as ski boots are made to tango in.  My hike-a-bike for 40 minutes, plus my lack of overall fitness kept me toward the back of the pack.</p>

<p>As I lost touch with the back of the field, I started to crack.  Then I realized my Camelbak was getting awfully light.  I normally ride with 3 liters of water, and only had 2 with me for this race because it was only an hour and a half.  No biggie, except I took a broken-chain-induced detour an hour earlier so now I was running low on water.  </p>

<p>At that point, I knew I was out for a third lap.  I wouldn't have enough water unless I stopped and picked up a screw-top water bottle.  You know how they can be a pain to open while you're driving a car?  Imagine having 1" of rubber on the ground with rocks and roots and whatnot and trying to open one and take a drink while keeping that 1" strip of rubber somewhat attached to the ground and avoiding as many of those rocks and roots as possible.  It wasn't going to happen, so I did what any self-respecting expert racer (data based on a poll of one self-proclaimed expert racer) and decided to finish last in <em>style</em> (say it like <a href="http://gallaghersmash.com/">Gallagher</a>).  I stopped to talk with the course marshal and have a beer with him while time ran out on the clock.</p>

<p>There was a "maze" of sorts on the course.  It was a really tight, technical series of flat switchbacks between trees.  Successful navigation generally involved leaning on several trees on your way through.  It was faster to run than it was to ride as several racers proved while I was spectating.  Without a marshal would have been cut.  It was a good spot to watch the traffic go by.  I know... because while I was sitting there, I got lapped by most of the field.  Some of those guys were flying.</p>

<p>While I was visiting with the marshal, I found out his mother lives in El Paso and he spent a far amount of time living there while he was growing up!  He goes back once a year to visit.  We were swapping stories about places we've ridden there.  He's done the Transmountain to Anthony Gap, as well as the Alamogordo to Cloudcloft climb.  Small world indeed.</p>

<p>On my drive down and back on Sunday, I had confirmed my belief that with the exception of little pockets of cosmopolitan life in Missouri (aka St. Louis and Kansas City), it is a backwoods state.  On the side of Highway 71 - not as bad as I-35, but still a major north/south highway in Missouri - someone had one of those <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=monster%20trucks&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">monster trucks</a> parked in the side yard of their house.  I'm serious... Big ol' 3' tires and all.  But wait, it gets better.  One of the wheels was off and the thing was on concrete blocks!  So not only do they have a monster truck in their yard, but they've got a monster in their yard on blocks!</p>

<p>Anyway, that's my weekend in a nutshell.  This evening, I got up close and personal with trees and some dirt.  First time I've had any major abrubt stops on a bike in months and I caught two tonight at Smithville.  Nothing's broke, but let's just say I'm not expecting full mobility of the right arm for awhile... You know it had the potential to be a pretty bad wreck when one of your first reactions is to count your teeth with your tongue to make sure they're all still there.  Man, it feels good to be mountain biking again! :)</p>

It's not surprising that they have ties to the Republican party though.  The Republicans are in power in Texas, and they're dying to get back on the gambling band-wagon.  You grease whoever's palms you need to when you're talking that kind of money.  At least if you <em>are</em> in the "I'm an Indian god-damnit!" category of folk.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know, that's a phrase that's not used often enough... <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a> that is.  I guess it's because all of the news - well, almost all of the news - we get is paid for by <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a>.  Shouldn't surprise me, but I guess I'm an eternal optimist...</p>

<p>Anyway, our Congress passed a bill that limits the relief available to those down on their luck.  Bankruptcy has been a way to get a clean slate and start over when the worst - a job loss, huge medical emergency, etc. - happens.  This was done to prevent "abuse" of the system, but the Senate rejected amendments that would have really limited the abuse of those who stand to gain the most - the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/">Senator Schumer</a> proposed an amendment - # 42 - that would have limited the amount of money allowed in an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:asset%20protection%20trust">asset protection trust</a>.  These are used by CEOs and the like to protect everything they own.  You know the new laws that hold CEOs accountable if they cook the books?  Now, every soon-to-be CEO sets up an asset protection trust to manage everything he owns so when he fudges on the books and gets sued he owns nothing - his trust owns it all.  You can sue 'til the <a href="http://www.cowtowncycling.com/">cows</a> come home, but he won't have anything to pay you with.</p>

<p>Personally, I find it revolting that this hasn't lead the news.  If they were truly out to reform the bankruptcy laws, they would be targeting the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a>.  Instead, they're pandering to them... and the credit card companies that greased this bill through Congress.  Where's the outrage?  Just here I suppose...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Warning: Programming-speak stuff coming up</em></p>

<p>During my morning reading, I came across <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul M. Jones'</a> <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=133">post</a> on the Semantic Web.  This guy always has good thoughts if you're a programmer.  Anyway, the <a href="http://theryanking.com/blog/archives/2005/04/07/an-evolutionary-revolution/">article he linked to</a> had some interesting thoughts on building micro-content, but things didn't get good until I started looking through <a href="http://theryanking.com/blog/">Ryan's</a> references.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A few clicks later - 2 degrees of seperation away - I came across <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN - XHTML Friends Network</a>.  In a nutshell, you adjust the links in your <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define%3Ablogroll">blogroll</a> to include a <code>rel</code> attribute that denotes if someone is a <em>friend</em>, <em>co-worker</em>, <em>neighbor</em>, <em>spouse</em>, someone you've <em>met</em>, etc. (the full list of associations is available on <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/join">XFN: Getting Started</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, with a blog software that knew of XFN, you would just be hitting checkboxes saying that you've met this person or that and consider them a friend or an acquaintance.  Then a search engine comes along, sees all of these links, and files them away as people you know with the various relationships you've set.  When someone goes to a search engine and searches for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">Travis Swicegood</a>" they not only find my site (because I've linked to myself as <em>me</em>), but they also are presented with links to view all of my co-workers, or neighbors, or friends, or people I've met, etc., etc.  It's basically Friendster or Orkut let loose on the web.</p>

<p>Of course, I imagine this doesn't sound all that exciting to my normal readership, but I know there are a few programmer-types who read the site from time to time.  I think through this practical example, they'll see how big of a deal <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats">microformats</a> could potentially be.</p>

        <title>Second 6 hour race under my belt</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/04/03/second_6_hour_race_under_my_belt/"/>
        <updated>2005-04-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/04/03/second_6_hour_race_under_my_belt</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I'm officially insane.  Yesterday I finished my second 6 hour race of the season up at Smithville's Smith Fork Trails.  The course was short, 3.5 miles, but brutal.  It was nearly all double-track, but there were a lot of really nasty transitions from descents to climbs.  There's one in particular that was 20+ <abbr title="mile per hour">mph</abbr> descent for  100 yards followed by a granny gear (by the end of the day) climb for 25 yards.  That constant up and down took its toll yesterday.</p>

<p>I didn't race the whole 6 hours.  I pulled out with about 30 minutes to go.  I was in 4th and thought the guy in 3rd had cracked and I would be able to over take him.  At five and a half hours, we were staying even.  Short of him having a mechanical and having to drop, there was no way I was going to pick up that last place so I pulled out.  I was two or three laps up on the guy in 5th and when all was said and done two or three laps out of 3rd.  When I pulled out, the guy in third was about 15 minutes in front of me.</p>

<p>My legs are doing remarkably well today.  The <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/03/20/what_i_learned_from_riding_my_bike_for_6">last race</a> was harder on me the day after for sure.  That's always a good sign as it means I'm starting to get my cycling strength back.  So far this year I think I've put in 20 hours on the bike, and over half of it has been in these last two races.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I spent the last hour and a half of the race in a perma-cramp that I was only able to push through with copious amounts of caffeine - which is a great pain-killer if you didn't already know it - and mental focus.  When  I saw it wasn't going to be possible to make up that last spot, though, my focus gave out and I couldn't keep going.  I knew I was in trouble when I had to start rolling the jumps in the course because my quads wouldn't take the punishment of landing.</p>

<p>The question invariably comes up.  Why do I put myself through something that borders on torture?  I guess because I can.  Yesterday, I road 49 miles in about five and a half hours.  There's a weird kind of pleasure I take from spending more time <strike>I</strike> <em>on</em> my bike in one afternoon than most people like to spend in a car.  Think about it.  When was the last time you spent 5 hours in a car?  </p>

<p>That's the same reason why people do a century on a road bike - there's a lot of people who rarely go 100 miles in a car at one time.  Imagine doing it on a bike.  Most people can't.  Of course, you have to be kinda crazy to enjoy this kind of "fun", but like I said... I'm officially insane :)</p>

        <title>All things great and small</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/31/all_things_great_and_small/"/>
        <updated>2005-03-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/31/all_things_great_and_small</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a believer that all things we do, great or small, have some impact on the greater whole of existence.  It's the "butterfly-flapped-its-wings-and-caused-a-tornado-to-form-in-Kansas" idea.  Whatever we do, affects not only us, but those around us in ways that we can't imagine.  It could be said that I believe in karma, or causality, or whatever the current term de jour is.  That's one reason why I can't understand littering.  </p>

<p>I'm not talking about rolling up to the ride of the an old dirt road with a pickup loaded down with this week's trash and a couch or two and throwing it off in a ditch.  To me, littering and "dumping" are too different things.  When I talk about littering, what comes to mind are the candy wrappers, fast food cups, and most insidious of all - the cigarette butt.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When you spend time on your bike pedaling down the road at 15 - 20 miles per hour without a car and air conditioning shielding you from your surroundings, you notice all the litter that has amassed on the sides of roads.  In some areas, such as the <strike>PARK NAME park</strike> West Terrace Park on the western slopes of downtown or off the side of Cliff Drive, it's worse than others, but there's trash everywhere.  What makes people think that the community as a whole wants what they're casually tossing aside?</p>

<p>I have an idea.  Local blogger <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~k8tertot/">Katie</a> sort of touched on it in her recent <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~k8tertot/20822.html">"hypothetical" post</a>.  While she didn't come up with the answer herself, I think the situation she described is caused by people being so concerned with themselves that when something doesn't directly effect <em>them</em>, it seems to have no effect at all.  Call it the yang of the "I want it now" culture.  Instead of "I want", the ideology that fuels littering is the "I don't want", therefore I must get rid of it immediately - damn the consequences.</p>

<p>But what consequences are they damning?  Though I wouldn't know where to look up such things, I imagine the number of citations actually written last year for littering are miniscule.  Think about it, how many times have you see a cigarette butt fly out the window?  How many times has it not even registered with you that someone just did that?  The candy wrapper <strike>on</strike> in the drainage ditch.  Did you even see it there?  Littering is a crime against all of us that has been marginalized so much that it doesn't even register with most people.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm being utopian.  Maybe it is too much to expect people to give a damn about what they're doing that effects other people and their environment.  Maybe.  But what if I'm wrong?  What if people do care about the impact they're having?  And what if those people would start to say something?</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/27/when_the_stars_stack_up_against_you</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... pay attention to them.  I decided it was too nice of a day not to spend part of it on a bike.  Feeling averse to setting up my road bike, I decided to give the <a href="http://www.northlandtrails.org/mtb.htm">Smithville Trails</a> a shot.  I figured they would be a little wet, but that they'd be at least descent.  </p>

<p>As I got everything ready to go, I realized I didn't have my mountain bike shoes.  Apparently, I left them at the office Wednesday night after a ride downtown.  Not the brightest thing I guess, as <a href="http://www.sidiusa.com/mtbs/index.html">$230 shoes</a> should probably be accounted for most of the time.  I decided to use my road bike shoes, they're practically the same as my mountain bike shoes, they just don't have any tread for walking around.  If you're pedaling, that's fine, but they're not very good for hiking off-road.  Not having the right shoes was sign number one.</p>

<p>Once I drove the 30 minutes up to the trail head and got started, my chain was making a ton of noise.  It's just like any other mechanical system, it needs to be lubed.  I haven't ridden my 29'er for several weeks and the chain was bone dry - something I didn't realize until I was half an hour from the house without any lube.  This was sign number two.</p>

<p>Probably 2/3rd's of the trails were fine, but that other third was really slick and messy.  There were a few sections that I had to bypass on foot - with my road shoes, mind you, that have absolutely no tread.  That was sign number three.</p>

<p>Three signs, three stars in Orion's belt, three deities in the Holy Trinity, three sides to a triangle, three days from Good Friday to Easter, three degrees to become a Master Mason - I should have seen the signs and hightailed it back to the car.</p>

<p>I was about 30 minutes in to my ride on trails that were questionable with a squeaky chain and my road bike shoes and it happened.  The chain, which had been complaining profusely for half an hour decided it had enough.  The power-link gave out - the first time I've ever had one of them fail on me.  I decided not to try to fix the chain, as it would just weaken the chain when a $3 or $4 powerlink will make the chain as good as new.</p>

<p>So, my day in the woods riding my bike turned into a nice hike in shoes that aren't very comfortable to walk in.  Could have been worse, but still... when road blocks keep popping up out of the blue, it's probably a good idea to pay a little attention to them.  Sometimes its just not in the stars to do what you want to.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My grandparents have been in town this weekend for Easter, and I love the unique artifacts of information they have amassed in their combined 140+ years on earth.  We were talking about all of the breweries that are currently in Missouri and my grandfather piped up with all of different beers that used to be brewed out of St. Louis.  "You had Stag, and Falstaff, and Greasydick -"  "Umm... what?" I countered.  "Yeah, the Greasydick Brothers," my grandmother chimed in.</p>

<p>I lost it.  What a name...  Turns out, they spell it <a href="http://www.gb-beer.com/">Griesedieck</a>, but the pronunciation is supposedly correct.  They are sitting on a gold-mine for a novelty beer.  Think about the shirts.  "I had a Greasydick in ..."  It's so tasteless it would work.</p>

<p>But what's really sad is that it's someone's name.  Imagine poor Joe Griesedieck at a bar.  "Hi... -- insert small talk -- So what's your name?  Mine?  It's Joe.  Joe Griesedieck" followed by a shower of liquid from a glass, can, bottle of whatever she's drinking being thrown at him.  Poor guy.  <strike>Of course, it's so tasteless that it might work for him.</strike></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Techie warning: This post is about technical stuff...  If you're a programmer, you'll get it.</em></p>

<p>Right now I feel like a dumb nut.  I've spent yesterday afternoon narrowing down a bottleneck in some software I've programmed and I just found the problem.  My query to the database for a zipcode was like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>SELECT * FROM Zipcodes WHERE zipcode = 64101</code></p></blockquote>

<p>The zipcode field was indexed, it was doing what it should but was taking .005 of a second.  Not long unless you start doing it for hundreds or thousands of zipcodes; then it becomes seconds worth of waiting.  The problem was the <code>zipcode</code> field was a string field and I was using an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define%3Ainteger">integer</a>.  So I changed the query to:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>SELECT * FROM Zipcodes WHERE zipcode = "64101"</code></p></blockquote>

<p>And my execution time dropped to 0.0006.  Much, much, more manageable.</p>

<p>Sometimes its the simplest things.  I don't know how many times I looked at that query before it dawned on me that the integer-to-string conversion was happening on every query.</p>

        <title>What I learned from riding my bike for 6 hours...</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/20/what_i_learned_from_riding_my_bike_for_6/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/20/what_i_learned_from_riding_my_bike_for_6</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, officially I rode it for 5:58.30.  I didn't want to hook up my light for another lap, though that would have picked up at least one more place.  Spending 6 hours pedaling around a cross-country course gives you a lot of time to think, and I picked up a few things:</p>

<ul><li>Never, I repeat <strong>never</strong> go to the race without having the necessities to start on time.</li>
<li>Caffeine is a wonderful thing.</li>
<li>Cramps can be pushed through.</li>
<li>It's damn fun to ride for that long...</li></ul>
<!--more-->
<p>First off, I convinced <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/">my parents</a> that it would be fun for them to spend their entire Saturday being my pit crew at the race.  They'd have water and food ready for me so I could eat, switch out bladders in my <a href="http://www.camelbak.com/rec/cb_prod.cfm?catid=6&amp;product_id=351">Camelbak</a>, and be on my way.  I got everything ready, and had the bladders on ice in the cooler that they took.  They weren't going to follow me directly, but I explained how to get there and my dad had already looked it up on a map.  I got a call 15 minutes before start time, "I think we're lost."  They had turned the wrong way on Highway 7 and were now about 20 miles away.  </p>

<p><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/mapimage.gif" border="0" alt="Where they were in relation to me" class="imgRight" />For those of you who don't know the area, the map on the side shows where they called from, and where I was.  Thankfully, the race started 5 minutes late because of some unexpected traffic delays.  They pulled up as the whistle blew to start the race.  I was the last one across the start finish line on my way to ride.  It was a Lemans start - <strike>be</strike> we ran for a 1/4 or 1/2 mile to the bikes then started riding.  I was still adjusting my Camelbak as I started running and once I got situated, I probably passed 15 people.  Before I got to the single-track, I passed another half dozen, then got stuck.</p>

<p>The problem with starting at the back of a mountain bike race is that will invariably get in the single-track and get stuck behind someone who's slow.  Thankfully, most of them let everyone by within a couple hundred yards, but had I been ready to go at the start I might have been able to start a little faster.  As it was, I turned in a sub-45 minute lap for my first lap which I was definitely pleased with since I started last. :)</p>

<h2>Caffeine, the wonder drug</h2>

<p>I knew this already, but it got reenforced yesterday.  Caffeine is a beautiful thing.  I should erect a shrine to the goddess of caffeine.  I could pour out a little Red Bull or Mountain Dew every day and burn incense on the alter.</p>

<p>Seriously, after lap 6 I drank a <a href="http://www.180.com/180dotcom.html">180 Energy Drink <strike>Sports Water</strike></a>.  My last two laps had been 55 minute - cramps and all.  Lap seven came in at nearly 45 minutes.  I was still on the verge of cramping, but I was able to push a higher gear before my legs started to rebel.  I doubt I could handle an energy drink a lap, but I could handle a <a href="http://www.vivarin.com/">Vivarin</a> every lap or two.  The kicker with caffeine for me is to manage the caffeine crash - when it wears off, if you're still on the course it would be like bonking without the cramps or vomiting.  I'd be going nowhere fast.  Which brings me to...</p>

<h2>Cramps, pleasantly intolerable spasms</h2>

<p>I don't cramp up.  During all of the racing I've done, I only came close to cramping once, in my second race.  On the average, I've drank 3 liters of water every day for the last 3 years.  I've only been mildly dehydrated a couple of times during that period and only once or twice has it been on a bike.</p>

<p>But yesterday's cramps weren't about water.  I was drinking enough and had drank enough the day before.  These cramps were about raw energy.  I didn't eat right yesterday, and a little over 3 hours into the race I started to pay for it.</p>

<p>It started when I tried to stretch after lap three.  My leg locked on me, and it took a few minutes of massaging to get it back to a semi-normal state.  I knew if I could get it to move and get back on the bike I could spin it out quicker than just sitting there stretching it.  Once I got back on the bike, I was fine until the last climb up to the Family Trail and my entire left quad screamed "NO!".  I had to walk it off, as my leg was not going to cooperate with this torture any longer.</p>

<p>But once I got passed that, I was able to keep my legs in check.  They were on the verge of cramping laps 5 through 7, but by focusing away from the potential pain, I was able to keep them in check and keep moving.  That's the first time I've had to race where nearly half of the race is spent on the verge of cramping up - and hopefully it will be one of the last where it's my fault.  </p>

<p>Yesterday's experience just reminded be exactly how important it is to eat right.  Most people who are not involved in some sort of endurance sport think food is food is food.  There's a little difference between carbs and protein and fat to them, but little else.  Race your bike for six hours and see if you still think that.  So next big race like that, I'll be eating a lot better the week before the race. </p>

<h2>More fun than a T-Bird before her daddy took it away</h2>

<p>After talking about three hours on the verge of my muscles exploding, you may find it odd that anyone can consider it better than a stay at Abu Ghraib with the reservists, but it was <em>fun</em>.  There's something about being on a mountain bike for longer than most people can sit still in a car that's unbelievable.  I've got a long way to go until I'm back to where I was physically a year and a half ago, but I'll get there.</p>

<p>Thanks to the guys a <a href="http://www.heartlandrace.com/">Heartland</a> for putting on a great race, and to <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/">my parents</a> for playing pit crew for a day.</p>

        <title>Confessions of a Narcissist</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/09/confessions_of_a_narcissist/"/>
        <updated>2005-03-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/03/09/confessions_of_a_narcissist</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Confessions of a Narcissist</p>

<p>How does one realize they're a narcissist?  The dictionary defines it as someone who has an ?interest, often excessive, in one's own appearance, comfort, importance, or abilities.?  Well, that's the second definition of it anyway.  The first definition of narcissism is much kinder.  Simply ?self-love?.  Looking at it that way, its sort of like being a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/14/take_back_liberal">liberal</a>.  You can be either ? a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/14/take_back_liberal">liberal</a> or a narcissist ? and still be a pretty descent person.  Both, in moderation, have their place, but both have negative connotations.</p>

<p>This came up, in a round about way, in a conversation with a co-worker this evening.  We were talking about a mutual aquiantence who's newly single and living by herself for the first time.  Her new found independence has required an adjustment.  My comment, which triggered my thoughts of narcissism was along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote><p>I've never really been one to need the relationship ? I don't go chasing after one.  If it happens, great.  If not, well...</p></blockquote>

<p>How do you balance being a social being and being someone who's also independent?  For me, my time has always seemed in short demand.  Particularly when it's nice outside and the trails are ridable.  :)  Seriously though, there's so much I want to do and I try to do as much of it as I can.  That doesn't leave much room for intimate relationships, though.</p>

<p>So when does self-love cross over to narcissism?  I guess when you can't be bothered for anyone else's needs or wants.  Self-love, if it means being able to give to yourself, accepting yourself, and genuinely liking not only who you are striving to be, but also who you've become, can be a good thing.  In excess, however, it crosses that line that delineates a narcissist.  </p>

<p>Do I crossed that line?  I can't be my own judge, but I hope I've found that balance ? or moderation ? that keeps everything in check.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just sent the following letter to Senator Wheeler, per <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewtopic.php?p=1036#1036">Brent Hugh's request</a>.  I strongly encourage you to do the same.  Write something, give him a call.  Or do both!</p>

<blockquote><p>Senator Wheeler,</p>

<p>As a working member of your district in downtown Kansas City, I would like to voice my support for <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/05info/billtext/intro/SB372.htm">SB 372</a>.  I enjoy spending time my bicycle as a way to stay fit and enjoy the company of friends, old and new.  Missouri should everything it can to insure that those of us who participate in the sport can do so in a safe manner.  </p>

<p>As you may be aware, a <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewtopic.php?p=573">cyclist was recently stuck</a> by a disgruntled driver who thought that the cyclist had no business on the road.  In an unfortunate turn of events, the driver was not charged.  304.678 provides a clear definition of how a motor vehicle should overtake a cyclist, and would have insured that the cyclist was not blamed for the accident, as the responding police officer did, but would properly assign the guilt to the driver.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and service.  I certainly hope you will support <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/05info/billtext/intro/SB372.htm">SB 372</a> and the rights and protections it guarantees to your cycling constituents.</p>

<p>Travis Swicegood</p>

<p>As a side note, is it just me, or does the <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/webmail/mail_form.aspx">email form</a> on the Missouri Senate site seem awfully small?  Are they just trying to keep people from commenting?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a brain teaser for you.  While watching Law &amp; Order this evening - what can I say, I do enjoy the original L&amp;O series from time to time - I saw two commercials that flashed this across the screen in fiery, medieval script:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ominent Finis Iminent</p></blockquote>

<p>At first glance, it looks Latin.  <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> only has an entry for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=finis">finis</a>.  <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/ominent">ominent</a> appears in the <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/">PseudoDictionary</a> as a combination of ominous and imminent.  The last looks like an old spelling of the word eminent.  So I'm thinking the "evil end is coming" or "the end of evil is coming".</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a rant...  Read on at your own risk</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To MoDOT contract workers;</p>

<p>I hope you burn in hell.  You are vile low-lifes, a waste of the precious resources that your existence consumes.  You waste the tax payer's time and money.  You are inconsiderate.  Oh, and did I mention that you work at the back of a pet store?  You are so despised that the state won't even get you a real office.  No!  You  have to go to work amid chew toys and litter boxes.</p>

<p>You know, I felt sorry for the MoDOT employees who lost their jobs when Baby Blunt remodeled his office instead of paying their salaries... No more!  I hope Blunt can find other offices, lobbies, stairwells, rooftops, and restrooms in need of an interior designer's expert eye.  Please, Mr. Governor, spend all of MoDOT's money so you can quit paying these inconsiderate low-lifes to consume my entire day!  They do a job that a computer should have been doing years ago.</p>

<p>sigh...  Now that feels much better.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you thought twice before you plugged in the coffee machine or flipped the switch for electricity?  You should.  Three people will die today because they were electrocuted in their home.  Scary, huh?  Think of all of the times you didn't even pay attention to the risk involved with that morning cup of joe.</p>

<p>What's worse, when you drive to work today you could be one of the <a href="http://webapp.cdc.gov/cgi-bin/broker.exe?_service=v8prod&amp;_server=lscb5500&amp;_port=5081&amp;_sessionid=/JxCWTc0Gz9&amp;_program=wisqars.details10.sas&amp;_service=&amp;type=U&amp;age1=.&amp;age2=.&amp;agegp=AllAges&amp;deaths=106742&amp;_debug=0">hundred and twenty people to die</a> today in a motor vehicle!  Think about it.  By plugging in the coffee machine or cranking up the car you could join the ranks of over a hundred people who are going to die... today.  The fear can be nearly paralyzing, can't it?</p>

<p>?There are two types of mountain bikers.  Those who have crashed, and those who will.?  It's an oft quoted proverb of mountain biking.  I have some family members and friends who think I'm crazy because of the places I go biking and the terrain I go biking over.  I've got several mother's who worry about me every time they know I'm on a bike.  But do you know how many <a href="http://bicycleuniverse.info/transpo/almanac-safety.html">cyclists are killed</a> every year?  Less than 700.  That means two should die sometime in the next 24 ? 36 hours.  </p>

<p>I guess that means I should spend more time on my bike and less time with electrical devices such like TVs and computers.  They're downright dangerous compared to my bikes.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's note</legend>No ? I don't really go around thinking about things like this.  Last night I spent the better part of the evening listening to folks at <a href="http://www.earthriders.org">ERTA</a> talk about mountain bike trail building, the liability involved, and how to minimize that.  It's great to see all of the focus on removing the unnecessary liability risks involved with trail building.  I'm glad ERTA is made up of mountain bikers, though, who realize that ?shit happens?.  All in all, bikes are pretty safe.  And when we do our part in making sure the trails we build are sound, we've just got to go for it.  There's nothing more mountain biker'ish than that.</fieldset>

        <title>Quick weekend recap</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/22/quick_weekend_recap/"/>
        <updated>2005-02-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/22/quick_weekend_recap</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's lunch time and I'm waiting on lunch to get here, so here's a quick recap of the weekends events.</p>

<p>It didn't rain as bad as was expected.  Friday was perfect - I have a few pictures of sunsets that will be going up on <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">Me and Travis</a> soon - I'm seriously going to start attempting to post more to that site.  Anyhow, Saturday it started drizzling in the morning.  Within 30 minutes of starting, however, it had stopped and would just stay grey the rest of the day.  </p>

<p>I was manning one of the string trimmers all day Saturday and Sunday.  I probably walked a mile swinging that sucker back and forth.  As the trail hadn't been <a href="http://www.imba.com/resources/trail_building/images/ts_bench_cut_trails_full.jpg">benchcut</a>, I spent the day with my downslope leg taking up the slack.  Currently my left leg (the downslope one) feels lopsided.</p>

<p>Me and a few of the other guys building trails this weekend split a cabin at the state park.  It was a very cool little cabin with a great wood burning stove in the corner.  <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6">Nate</a> made a great observation while we were sitting there enjoying the fire.  He wondered aloud if somewhere in our primitive brain that makes us want to stare at something glowing after the sun goes down.  A fire while you're out camping can become entrancing, and who hasn't seem people in a trance like state in front of the boob-tube?  Wouldn't it be funny if all this time, primetime TV was taking advantage of evolution?</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's it for now.  Lunch is here and I'm still trying to recover from what I'm sure was a caloric deficit this weekend.</p>

        <title>eGel vs Hammer Gel</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/22/egel_vs_hammer_gel/"/>
        <updated>2005-02-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/22/egel_vs_hammer_gel</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was asked yesterday how I thought <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">Crank Sports' eGel</a> compared to Hammer Gel.  I thought Crank would have the comparison on their web site, but that is one of the products they didn't compare themselves to.  I started thinking maybe it was because Hammer Gel was at least equal, so I pulled out the last packet of Hammer Gel I have and started a comparison.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To start with - Crank has better packaging.  Ok, I know that has nothing to do with how well the product works, but anyone who can put "Harder Faster Longer" on their packaging has a one up on any of the competitors.  All other things being equal, eGel just won.</p>

<p>But all things aren't equal.  First off, there is more gel in an eGel packet than Hammer Gel.  Sure, throw more gel at the problem and of course it will have a higher caloric (wow, I've used "caloric" twice in one day, I sound like a trainer) value.  The first thing to do is divide the number of total calories in a serving by the number of grams in in a serving.  The result:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" border="0"><caption>eGel vs Hammer Gel</caption>
<tr><td> </td>
<td>Total Calories</td>
<td>Serving Size</td>
<td>Total Calories per Gram</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hammer Gel</td>
<td>91</td>
<td>36g</td>
<td>2.526/gram</td></tr>
<tr><td>eGel</td>
<td>150</td>
<td>55g</td>
<td>2.727/gram</td></tr></table>

<p>If you've looked at the comparison chart that Crank Sports provides, you'll notice one missing field in this comparison: sugar.  One of the top selling points Crank touts: less sugar.  Where 18.66% of the calories in an eGel come from sugar, most gels contain about 20% with Clif Shots coming in at 50%!  Including Hammer Gel would seem to undermine their #2 claim because it only gets 8.79% of its calories from sugar with a meager two grams of sugar.</p>

<p>Of course, by cutting the sugar they are cutting the total calories you get as demonstrated in the table above.  Among other differences is the amount of potassium.  According to the nutritional facts on Hammer Gel, it does not contain any while eGel contains 85mg.  Another area that eGel surpasses Hammer Gel is sodium.  If you sweat a lot, you're loosing sodium and need to build it back up.  Hammer Gel contains 23mg while eGel contains 230mg - a ten fold increase.  If you're like me and sweat a lot while you're riding, replenishing sodium can be huge.</p>

<p>Of course, ingredients aren't enough for someone to make up their mind.  Taste matters.  I've had a few types of gels that I couldn't hardly stomach and I even had one that I had an allergic reaction to.  Thankfully, Hammer Gel and eGel are both pretty palatable.  Hammer Gel sticks with more "organic" flavors like orange, chocolate, strawberry, while Crank Sports goes for the more dramatic with Cherry Bomb, Topical Blast, and Mountain Rush.  Considering that neither contain taurine or caffeine, the flavor issue is more a personal choice.  While I perfer Crank's flavors as more stimulating, I can handle an orange Hammer Gel without too much issue.</p>

<p>And finally, the most important part of a gel.  Does it work?  Short of a controlled experiment where I test my fitness using both products under identical situations while I'm at the same fitness level, anything I say here is subjective.  That said, both provide a good solid amount of energy.  Personally, I find that my energy levels stay higher with eGel than with Hammer Gel. Hammer Gel provides a good steady amount of energy, but tends to start to wane after about 20 minutes.  eGel has always seemed to help out for at least 30 minutes and on at lower efforts seems to help for at least 45 minutes.  I use the word "seem" because without a power monitor, it's hard to say with certainty.</p>

<p>So there's a rough comparison between Hammer Gel and eGel.  If you have a problem digesting sugar, Hammer Gel might be the right way to go.  If you have issues with sodium loss while you're riding, eGel is definitely going to be better.  Both are great products, but for the time being I'm sticking with eGel.  It's nice to show up to a ride with something different :)</p>

<p><strong><em>Closing request</em></strong><br />
I'm currently trying to get win <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/challenge/leaders.asp?rid=323371">Crank's Winter Challenge</a>.  I didn't find out about it until a week ago, and already I'm up to 4th place.  If you're a regular reader of my site and would like to help out, leave a comment and fill in the "email address" field and I'll send you a referal.  If you sign up via any of the <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">Crank Sports</a> links that I have on my site, I'll get 3 points for your sign-up, but if I can email you before hand I get an extra point.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that I have applied for a spot on <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/teamcrank/?rid=323371">Team Crank</a> and may be racing for them this year.  That application didn't effect this article - the guys in El Paso will attest that I've been pushing this stuff for awhile now without any sort of sponsorship.</fieldset>

        <updated>2005-02-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/15/a_great_audio_program</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Occasionally, I'll hear something on the radio that just won't let me leave my car.  NPR has a phrase for these - <a href="http://shop.npr.org/catalog/Product.jhtml?CATID=&amp;PRODID=prod360002">driveway moments</a>.  Tonight was one such case.</p>

<p>I was coming back from a meeting of the Lakeside Cycling Club and was tuned to <a href="http://www.kcur.org">KCUR</a> listening to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a>.  Tonight's program, Episode 282, was about a man who was wrongly convicted of murder and served more than 20 years in prison.  This is a story about what can happen when the system goes wrong, but more importantly it is the story of a friend who wouldn't give up.  <em>Carl King</em> spent 21 years working for his friend.  Talking to anyone who would listen.  Hoping against what would seem like insurmountable odds that he could prove what he knew - his friend was innocent.</p>

<p>This is well worth the hour long listen.  You can <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/ra/282.ram">listen to it here</a> in RealAudio format, or you can <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/webwares/basket.jtmpl?act=addbycode&amp;code=282">purchase a CD of the program</a> for $13.  If you enjoy radio, consider purchasing this as an investment in the excellent shows that <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a> puts on.  I don't want to ruin the end of it, but you've got to listen to the point that the lawyer makes at the end.  Very, <strong>very</strong> powerful.</p>

        <title>Religious beliefs of a pseudo-intellectual</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/13/religious_beliefs_of_a_pseudo_intellectu/"/>
        <updated>2005-02-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/13/religious_beliefs_of_a_pseudo_intellectu</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last week's rainy day Sunday post I outlined what caused me to split from the formalized church, or ?organized religion?.  This week I'm going to tackle my religious thoughts.  Last week I included a footer noting that my thoughts were controversial, I think that warning should go at the start of this article.  To Christians who believe in what they believe in without having ever questioned any of it, parts of this post will probably border on blasphemy.</p>

<p>Now that you've been forewarned, let us continue...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As was mentioned in my previous post, I was raised in the Christian church.  Methodist to be exact.  My younger years were informed by weekly Sunday school attendance, and participation in church youth groups and Bible studies.  To make complete my prototypical ?Christian? upbringing, I was even home schooled for the majority of my primary education ? using the ABeka school curriculum.  If you're not aware of ABeka, you need only visit the local private Christian school to find it.  Their American history books reveal the influence of backlash culture in their writing.  The fall of the stock market in '29?  Caused by farmers and their self-interested desire for paper money.  The Klu Klux Klan?  A social group dedicated to the preservation of Anglo-American culture that was unfortunately briefly acquiesced, by radicals who deviated from its original and intended purposes.  Science?  A field full of fools who had turned their back on the rational teaching of the Bible in favor of circular arguments such as the practice of archaeologists where bones and materials are dated by the layer of earth in which they were found and the layer of dirt is aged by the artifacts that are found in it (they seriously spent a full page ?debunking? that topic!) ... You get the picture.</p>

<p>It was no fault of my parents, they were using what was available to them.  Thankfully, they encouraged discussion about what was being covered and acknowledged that the source of the material should be taken into consideration.  ABeka's backlash inspired history and science books actually inspired a backlash of its own.  I became a liberal, in the original sense of the word.  I questioned what I was being told, whether it was from a history book, the nightly news, or the pulpit.</p>

<p>This questioning got me curious in other religions.  If Christianity was supposed to be the way, what about all of the other religions?  Had they got some part of it right, were they all damned to hell, or were they all getting to the same mountain top by a different route?  After some amateur investigation, I determined that at their core nearly every religion or philosophy has the very same message ? we're all in this together and should be our brother's keeper.  To me, this is the epitome of ?love your neighbor as yourself.?  These revelations all came at a very volatile time in my spiritual life ? the witch burnings I mentioned in last week's article.  As I started to look at my Bible, I  started to realize that every definitive answer ? every black and white ?truth? ? wasn't presented by Jesus in the gospels, rather they were presented later by Paul, or those writing under Paul's name.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is a sin?  Look no further than Paul.  A woman's place?  Jesus seemed to include them, but Paul took care of that.  The divinity of Christ?  Jesus said ?you say I am?, Paul swore that was a yes.  I started to see a pattern emerge.  Paul and those writing as him had perverted Christianity.  He took a philosophy, a way of life ? love your neighbor as yourself ? and turned it into a religion.  Acts documents an argument between Paul and Peter.  Ironically, Paul came down on the side of disregarding the old traditions and allowing anyone to become a Christian.  Those writing in his name later would append this view to fit their view of who should be excluded.  The widespread acceptance as gospel truth what came after the Gospels started me questioning even more...</p>

<p>Then I discovered the gnostic gospels, in particular the Gospel of Thomas.  There is one passage that drove the final nail into the coffin of organized Christianity.  I will paraphrase it here:</p>

<p>The disciples asked, ?Teacher, where should we look for the Kingdom of Heaven??</p>

<p>Jesus replied, ?Some say look to the heavens, but I say not for if the Kingdom of Heaven was in the heavens, surely the birds would get there before you.  Some say it is below us, but I say not for if the Kingdom of Heaven was below us, surely the fish would get there before you.  I say look inside, for the Kingdom of Heaven resides in each of us.?</p>

<p>A light went on ? the connection between Christ and Buddha was made for me.  There wasn't a heaven with 50 virgins or 50 planets or streets paved with gold as so many religions had proclaimed.  Those were tools to delay gratification from this life to a future one.  In a society where hardships abound and sacrifice is necessary, this serves its purpose.  In today's society, however, it does nothing but repress.  The Kingdom of Heaven that is discussed in the New Testament is not the second coming of Jerusalem.  It is not some airy existence after our mortal bodies pass from this realm.  It is a way of life...  It is a personal calmness, a quiet self-assuredness... it is inner peace.  By loving your neighbor as you love yourself, you are committing yourself to a life that will be full.  By truly coming to the world with the wonder of a child as Jesus said, or with a non-knowing as a Zen master said, you can live a life that is full beyond comprehension.  This was the essence of the Biblical teachings of the New Testament ? as they spoke to me.</p>


<p>So how is this blasphemous?  Well, I never stop with one question.  I'm like that commercial a few years ago for a technology question; I never stop asking why.  After I felt I had answered the question of why some gospels had been discarded and other texts included, I started wondering what had happened to the man figure of Jesus.  Was it true that he was God incarnate?  If so, why?  If he became human, but still posed his deity abilities, what was the purpose?  Why?</p>

<p>Enter an author... Jonathan ? and ?I'm... the Legend of the Son of Man?.  As one of about 8 people, I went to a performance at a church of an abbreviated version of ?I'm...?.  I was hooked.  He had grappled with the same questions I was and it turned into a book.  He wrote of the man Jesus and the life that isn't chronicled in the gospels.  The events that happened between his birth and the time the gospel writers taken an interest in him.  Of course, it is all fictional, but it moved me to another conclusion.  Jesus was a man.  </p>

<p>Through his life, his unselfish, caring, compassionate life, he became the son of God.  He wasn't a deity.  He had been fashioned into one as Christianity became Romanized.  The Romans weren't interested in a life of quiet complacency.  They had their mythical gods who slew wild beasts and conquered the forces of nature.  Why should they be swayed by a homely Joe Smith, or Jesus.  He was just like any of the thousands of dissidents ? today he would be called an insurgent Rabbi ? that had been executed in Jerusalem.  Why was he any different?  The salesman in Paul took over and Jesus took on the mythical proportions he still largely enjoys today.</p>

<p>If you haven't figured out by now, my life advances by one discovery or realization leading to another question, which in turn leads to another discovery or realization, ad nauseam.  If Jesus was a man, and through his life he had become a ?son of God? - wasn't it possible for us each to achieve this same status?  If the Kingdom of Heaven was truly within each of us, isn't it possible that we can all aspire to, and possibly reach that same level?  The answer came to me as a resounding yes.  Maybe we don't sacrifice ourselves at the alter, but there is a little Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammed in each of us and with the right cultivation, I believe we can each encourage their growth.</p>

<p>Now, before you go leaving a comment, I'm not trying to say that I'm Jesus.  I am saying that I feel he, at his root, was no different than me or you or anyone else.  He just realized his true nature better than some of us.  Is he a deity worthy of worship?  Is the Buddha?  I don't think either are.  They both have set great examples to learn from and have provided excellent works to study and understand and follow... philosophically, but a deification of them sets them apart from us and encourages us to think that they exist on some unattainable plane, thus excusing our lax attitude toward our own spiritual health.</p>

<p>So, there you have it.  I believe that Paul, and his accredited works hijacked Christianity; that Jesus was a man like each of us; and that at some level we can all attain that oneness with a higher being ? call him (or her) God, Allah, the Grand Architect, Zeus, Mother Earth, the Force, or any other name that you might come up with.  I think the burden ? or privilege ? is on us.  We can't rely on a perfect Sunday church attendance, an across the board 10% tithe, or any other single thing ? other than our striving for perfection.  Thus I have come full circle.  One of the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist church, was that man should constantly be striving toward perfection.  Actually sounds very Buddhist to me.  At some point, we may attain that.  Though if we are ever asked if we are the son of man and our answer is yes, our vanity will have cost us that perfection.  Although, if we can with a clear heart answer, ?that is what you say I am?, then we might be closer than we realize.</p>

        <title>How I became disillusioned with the church</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/06/how_i_became_disillusioned_with_the_chur/"/>
        <updated>2005-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/02/06/how_i_became_disillusioned_with_the_chur</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a few recent posts, I've touched on articles of faith.  I've alluded to various positions I hold dear, but have yet to actually define them.  As it seems that I constantly have my sights aimed at radical, fundamentalist Christianity, I thought <strike>I</strike> it would only be fair that I give them some idea as to where I am coming from ? other than their perceived communist gay-monger.</p>

<p>First off, it should be noted that I was raised in a relatively Christian household.  I say relatively, because it wasn't considered the core of our existence.  Additionally, the environment I was raised in was conducive to questioning.  If something, or some teaching, didn't make sense my sister and I were taught to question it.  Essentially, I was raised to believe in constantly asking the proverbial ?why??.  In this diatribe, which I will warn you has become quite large, I will attempt to set the stage for how I felt compelled to leave the church.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So how did some did someone ?raised in the church? end up so far left of center when it comes to matters of religion?  As I've traced that path in the last few days I've found its origins in the root of two events at the same church.  As I entered the ?college aged? younger adults of the church, the classes the church was holding targeted toward me and my peers had completely lost my interest.  I was interested in a more scholarly class that critically examined the faith, not the faith-by-numbers offered to the ?young? members of the church.  For those of you not familiar with a ?faith-by-numbers? type of class, it is to the thinker what a paint-by-numbers class is to the painter, a complete and utter waste of time and energy as there is no room for growth ? you do what you are told and that is it.  </p>

<p>I found solace in a small class filled with members twice my age, many of them the contemporaries of my own parents.  Their purpose had been the comparison of Christianity to other world religions, but had recently shifted to the purpose of exploring the origins of Christianity.  It wasn't to recount what the Bible said, but to explore what the contemporary historians, Josephus namely, had to say about the initial surge of the cult of Christianity.  It was an excellent class with  individuals who were open to questioning everything.  They were all admitted Conservatives, but found themselves confounded when test after test showed them to be liberal.  They were, in the original sense of the word.  This was fertile ground for the expansion of knowledge.</p>

<p>During the course of one of our discussions, it was brought up the minister of the church, someone I considered to be a free-thinker ? well, as much as a minister normally would be ? warned the guy who started the class.  ?Be careful when you start to explore the origins of Christianity.  You might tear down someone's faith.?  When I heard that, I was floored.  Was a minister's job not to ensure the strongest faith possible for his ?flock??  Would the process of guided creative destruction not be better for someone than having a faith that could be destroyed simply by knowing its origins?  How could the minister not applaud this attempt?  </p>

<p>Needless to say... I was disappointed.  My belief has been that a minister's job is to cultivate the members of their church to live the fullest life within the moral guidelines set down by their article of faith.  This particular minister, who I had always assumed strove for this lofty ambition managed to destroy my faith in him in two sentences.</p>

<p>That was one event, the other occurred prior, but by how much I don't specifically remember.  It would have probably been by a year or two, but it's occurrence rocked the church.  An older member of the church choir had his 20-something son come back to town.  His son was openly gay and had AIDS, which if memory serves he says he got during a blood transfusion.  This was no big deal, but those two attributes of himself are how he defined himself.  He wasn't an individual who happened to be gay and happened to have AIDS, rather he would introduce himself: ?Hi my name is Tim (not real name).  I'm gay and have AIDS.  I know that makes some people uncomfortable, so if it does you just let me know and I'll leave you alone.?</p>

<p>He was one of those types of guys ? gay or straight ? who could easily rub you the wrong way.  Personally, I could tolerate him.  He was a free thinker and enjoyed questioning things.  That made us kindred spirits.  He had a crush on me, but that wasn't my thing and we got along just fine as friends.  As you can imagine, Tim rocked the boat at the church.  Many were floored that someone they considered so openly contradicting the ?Word of God? could be allowed not only to attend church, but to participate in communion and act as an active member of the choir.  Truth be told, he wasn't that great of a singer, but he enjoyed it and could definitely be considered to have raised a joyful ?noise? unto the Lord.</p>

<p>This came to a head with a special ?meeting? - much like the Salem Witch Trials, without the burning at the stake at the end, and the ?accused? had already been essentially told to leave the church rather than be forced to face his accused.  The topic of the ?meeting? was the Bible's stance on homosexuality.  After some initial guidance by the minister (the same one mentioned above), the group broke into smaller groups of a half dozen or so.  Within the group I was in, I think I was the only one who was willing to read what the Bible said and come up with the conclusion that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality except in the Old Testament.  I'm completely prepared to disregard the Old Testament and consider a good source of history for the origins of the the Jewish and Christian people.  When I've read the Gospels I've come away from them with the understanding that one of Jesus' main objectives was to point out that reading the Torah (the Christian Old Testament) literally was dangerous and lead to the pharisee and their politically repressive grip over the people.  I'll save the comparisons to today's political-religious situation for another time.</p>

<p>These two events in tandem are what caused my disillusionment with organized religion.  The realization that a church's main goal was membership and not the development of its members and the insight that church members were more than willing to use ? rather abuse and distort ? their article of faith as a means of coping with something that felt unfamiliar or uncomfortable to their world-view made me realize that the path to inner peace did not include a weekly pilgrimage down the aisle with an hour or so spent in a pew.</p>

<p>The next time it's raining and quite here on a Sunday morning, I'll write out what I, as an ordained minister, actually do believe in.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>This contains a lot of controversial views, they are mine, and mine alone.  They have taken nearly a decade of critical thought on my part to develop and no matter how salient you believe your one paragraph comment is there's a 99.9% chance it isn't going to change my point of view one bit.  Quite the contrary, it will probably just reaffirm my belief.  I would ask that you keep that in mind if you leave a comment.  If things get out of hand, I will close the comments on this post.</fieldset>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Very cool... I just got mentioned on <a href="http://www.booktv.org/InDepth/murray.asp">C-SPAN's BookTV</a>!  The author <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Charles%20Murray%22">Charles Murray</a> mentioned that he reads blogs as part of his morning routine - so I emailed to ask if he keeps one, and why or why not.</p>

<p>He said he's not a first-draft writer.  He continually reworks <strike>what</strike> his writing until he finally reaches the end point, thus writing for a blog wouldn't quite work out.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that his personal writing style relies on drafting in the form of writing out a full version, then reworking it.  To me, it shows a talent that was honed prior to the ubiquity of computers and word processors.  Personally, as I write, I am constantly reworking the piece.  Sometimes it is to my own detriment - a sentence might look right as a read it, but as I <em>edit</em> it later it doesn't fit.  Nonetheless, I wonder how many other bloggers make drafts of their work, and how many of them constantly revise like I do.</p>

<p>Here's the email I sent it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Question for Charles Murphy</em><br /><br />
Hello Mr. Murray,</p>

<p>You mentioned that you read blogs as part of your morning routine.  Do you keep a blog?  Why or why not?</p>

<p>Travis Swicegood</p></blockquote>

<p>If you happened to hear it, they mispronounced my name.  It's pronounced like <em>twice</em> with an <em>s</em> not like swiss cheese.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Proving what Hitler learned nearly three quarters of a century earlier, <strong>hate</strong> still wins votes.  The new Kansas legislature has made one of their first priorities to not be outdone by the bigotry of its Missouri neighbors and has put an ammendment to it's constitution on the ballot to ban same-sex anything.  To quote one of Overland Park's most divisive "pastors" on one of the local TV news shows last night:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think this proves that people of faith need to exercise their right to vote.  All of the new members of the legislature voted for the ammendment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great... religious nuts found out there's power in voting!  Who told them?!  :)</p>

<p>It really looks like the Protestant movement has run its course.  Now they're using political power to affect the changes they deem "necessary" to perserving their way of life.  Seems like deja vu for the history buffs of us - I remember a church located at 1 Vacitan City Drive that incited its people to holy war, committed crimes against its own people, and generally tried to badger them into submission.  Ya know, come to think of it - this is just another place where the Evangelicals and Islamists have something in common!  Let's hope as they duke it out they don't take too many more innocents with them.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/01/26/car_dealers_gone_wild</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about getting a <a href="http://www.hybridcars.com/">hybrid car</a>.  I like the idea of the increased fuel economy and doing my part to help the environment out.  I would like to check out a Prius, but upon investigation yesterday I found out that there is as much as a two year waiting list and the local Toyota dealer has even stopped taking orders for them!  The only other one that I would be interested in is the Escape Hybrid from Ford.</p>

<p>Ok, now that you've got your jaw off of the floor... yes, I did say I was interested in an SUV.  It's an eco-friendly SUV, and I'm not your <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/23/another_reason_to_hate_some_suv_drivers">normal SUV driver</a>.  I put in a quick phone call to the local Ford dealership, and they have one in stock.  Last night I went to check it out, it's fully loaded.  Surprise, surprise, it's got <em>all</em> of the options so it costs the most.  But to top it off, it even has some extras... or so I thought.</p>

<p>After taking it for a spin, I stopped back by to check out the price before I head home.  The sticker MSRP is $32.8k.  Steep enough, but then there's a $4,000 "ADM" hand-written in marker added under "Dealer Installed Options".  It was late and I had already taken up enough of my salesman's time, so I just figured I would give him a buzz today.  This afternoon I was informed that the additional $4k was just added on over the MSRP because they're in such high demand!  You've got that right - they're tacking on more than 10% just because they feel they can!  Guess we now know that ADM stands for "Above Dealer Msrp"!</p>

<p>I know it's a supply and demand issue, but living here in KC we've been producing those Escape Hybrids for nearly a year and they're trying to say that in that time they're still on a "who knows when we'll get the next one" basis?  Can we say "price fixing"?  You know, it's great that these monopolies - err, benevolent giants are trying to help the environment out by <strong>finally</strong> producing vehicles that don't consume any more gas than they need to - I mean, the fact that oil reserves are on the short track to extinction has just come out of nowhere!  But seriously... 10% over retail.  Do I have to provide my own condom, or will you provide one while you rape me!</p>

<p>Geez... So, my hybrid adventures have ended for the time being.  I'm not going to pay full MSRP much less $4k over so I can save a hundred bucks or so a year in gas.  And with this <a href="http://www.hybridcars.com/calculator/index.php">spiffy calculator on HybridCars.com</a> I found out that my Hyundai actually emits less pollutants into the air than the Escape Hybrid would.  So I guess I'll do the environmentally sensible thing and stick with my small-engine, fully gas car.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just to let everyone know, I'm undergoing a week of <em>reading deprivation</em>...  No books, no blogs, no radio, no TV, no frivolous Internet.  If you want to talk about me on your blogs, this is the week to do it!  </p>

<p>Because of this new knowledge fast, I'm going to have nearly an extra hour a day commuting time in which I'm working on my podcast on wheels.  It's sort of like this blog, rambling, sometimes pointless, but if you stick with it you might just get something profound out of it (no guarantees though).</p>

<p>Finally, for those of you looking to the website for <a href="http://travisswicegood.com/index.php?cat=68">bike porn</a>, it's not here yet.  I'm still waiting on my Crossmax SL wheels and FSA carbon crank.  Both should be in one day this week, and when they're here I'll have it pictures!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WashingtonPost.com has a good article on the political battle that's going on internally in the Bush administration over global warming.  James Hanson says the administration is attempting to censor him.  Of Hason, Bush's chief science advisor, John Marburger said he is:</p>

<blockquote><p>"a very good climate scientist... I take his work seriously. His work has had a big impact on this administration's climate-change policy," Marburger said. "But he's not an economist. The fact that he's a good scientist does not necessarily make him the best person to formulate policy that would affect the economy."</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, good science, bad economics.  I'm glad they have their priorities straight though.  I'd hate to see long term goals such as... oh I don't know, <strong>sustaining life as we know</strong> guide their policy.  It's much better that next year's 401ks do well.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No.  I'm not coming out or anything like that, but this is brings up an interesting ethical question.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4188495.stm">group of researchers</a> have determined that the non-jock, male Australian cuttlefish are posing as female cuttlefish to get past the bigger counterparts and "[meet] females under rocks".  What they're doing under those rocks we'll leave to your imagination - let's just say there were lots more smaller cuttlefish swimming around now because it worked half the time!  </p>

<p>There were 41 delicate situations where the cuttlefish in drag were mistaken for real live females in dire need of a good mating.  There were bruised egos and embarrassed looks all around, and the bigger, more manly cuttlefish did have to rough the poor guy to send a message that he wasn't going to be played like that, but still... it worked half the time!</p>

<p>Ok... so now to the ethical question: is this article saying that pretending to be gay to get in a girls pants is not really playing her, but that it's only biology overruling common decency?  Or am I reading way too much into it? :)</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/01/18/quote_of_the_year</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Or at least today.  <a href="http://blogkc.com/archives/2005/01/school-funding-debate/">BlogKC</a> had a teaser for <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/97A671D0F245939286256F8A00221A20?OpenDocument&amp;Headline=Missouri+school+funding+is+under+fire">STL Post-Dispatch's article</a> on school funding in Missouri.  It's a good article, and worth the read, but the closing is priceless:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I cannot sit in the Missouri Capitol and worry about what some judge is going to do," said House Budget Committee Chairman <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/member/mem004.htm">Brad Lager</a>, R-Maryville.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah - it's not his concern if the laws he's passing or the budgets he's approving are legal, or constitutional or any of those minor things like that - he's just got to pass them!  Is it just me, or does that seem to be the political equivilant of "kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out!"?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roy Temple has a great <a href="http://www.templereport.com/archives/000503.html#more">post</a> on what the Democratic party is doing wrong.  To them, the validity of their point is so obvious, that it doesn't need explanation.  The American public is dumb.  I mean <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/media/torture-strongly-agree-agree-disagree-more-please-029639.php">18 precent</a> of Americans should just be shot for their mindnumbing contamination of the gene pool, but of that other 80% not that many are certifiably stupid, they just need some guidance.</p>

<p>When Republicans thrust Dubya on the world and they have a bumbling folkies kind of guy, the public can identify with him.  When he keeps repeating his message over and over and over and over - editor's note: "and over"s removed to keep this from become a volume - again, the public starts to get it.  When Kerry, or Edwards, or anybody else jumps around from point to point, touching on them briefly, relying on the Mensa-level intelligence of their constituancy to understand how they got to that conclusion, the public goes "huh?".</p>

<p>This reminds me of another point that was brought up by a local TV guy in response to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F0805073396">What's the matter with Kansas?</a>.  Frank Thomas did a good job with the book, but he missed one point - the people really don't care.  They're not involved with the body politic to the level most paritsans would like to believe.  They go with who they feel more comfortable with.  When the Republicans couch their arguments that business should be able to do business - aka screw the little guy a la Wal-Mart - in their down to earth demeanore and repeat it simply and often, the public feels they know them.  This is where the left is going wrong.</p>

<p>So how can they fix it?  They can go over to Audible and download <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/store/product.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1455163483.1105909612@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccccadddihliehkcefecegedfhfdhgg.0&amp;uniqueKey=1105909766370&amp;pageType=preliminaryResults&amp;productID=FR_ADBL_040728a">Al Sharpton's DNC address</a>.  Listen to it, understand it, and try to emulate it.  The Reverand is believes what he is saying - or at least is good at pretending - and he puts it simply.  The rest of the left needs to work on that.  You guys have got 4 years to get it down.</p>

        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2005/01/16/my_response_to_rick_mathes/"/>
        <updated>2005-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2005/01/16/my_response_to_rick_mathes</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/29/allah_or_jesus_a_response">posted an email</a> that I sent to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/29/allah_or_jesus_a_response">Rick Mathes</a>.  I received a quick response back from him, which actually shocked me.  I expected him to quietly ignore my complaint with his point of view, reassured by his infallible belief that God has ordained him specifically to reach out to those poor souls caught in the grips of Islam.  Based on <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/29/allah_or_jesus_a_response#c132">his response</a>, he feels as though it is his duty, but does feel he should respond to criticism.</p>

<p>Below I'm responding point-by-point.</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>Greetings in the Spirit of our Lord!</p></blockquote>

<p>I must say, that's not the note to start off with.  Who said that <em>my</em> lord is anywhere near the same as yours?  You can rest assured that I pay no homage to the Lord you purport to represent.  I do not subscribe to the belief that any deity I worship is the only one out there nor that it is my duty to evangelize to all of the other lost souls.  I know enough to know that I'm still one of the lost and should not be so arrogant as to attempt to remove a speck of sawdust from my brother's eye.</p>

<blockquote><p>Please criticize the message not the messenger.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm afraid I missed the part where I criticized the messenger.  I did say I was rather disturbed to find a minister so ignorant of the world in which he lives.  That is a personal belief I have made based on the information I've been presented with of you thus far and your response did not give me much reason to change that belief.</p>

<blockquote><p>I only asked the questions I honestly wanted the Imam to answer. If my presuppositions were wrong, they were mine and real. If his answers were wrong, they still were his. The message was:</p>

<p>"Would you rather have an Allah who says to kill me to go to heaven or a Jesus who says for me to love you because I am going to heaven and He would like you to be with me?"</p>

<p>This, for a Christian, is the highest order of LOVE to ask this question which I did.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really don't know where to start.  The fact that you still refer to this poor soul as an Imam shows your inability to readjust your world-view in light of new facts so anything I say here is just for the benefit of my own self and those you might read it as I know it will not sway you - a task which I have no interest in undertaking.</p>

<p>First, the separation of Allah and Jesus.  Is it not true that according to the theology that you subscribe to that Jesus is but God incarnate?  If so, then Allah is one and the same.  The Koran, if you would bother to read it instead of guess about it or rely on prison inmates for interpretation, spends the opening chapters tracing its Jewish and Christian history.  It is quite condemnatory of them both, saying that the former were too ignorant to realize when God had dropped a prophet - Jesus - in their laps and that the latter were too idolatrous for making a deity out of that same prophet.</p>

<p>A response to that last point is beyond what I would be willing to take on right now.  Suffice it to say, that when I look at all of the religious texts that came out of that period, I find it convenient that the Catholic church seemingly suppressed all of the material that doubted the necessity of foregoing a meaningful existence on this earth for one that will come in the next.  I see great similarities in the delayed gratification the church preached to that of current capitalist machine.  "Just put your money in this retirement fund and you'll live better tomorrow" or "just forego learning how to do anything but tend to your feudal lord's land, for there's a better tomorrow".  If that's your thing, then by all means go for it, but I think it is a better glorification of any deity that may have had a hand in my creation to live more fully in this moment rather than longing after the moment to come.</p>

<blockquote><p>In regards to Break the Chain, I have responded numerous times and they won't publish my response.</p></blockquote>

<p>Please know your responses will receive full airing on my website.</p>

<blockquote><p>This was a real event that I participated and recorded to the best of my ability. Please, this is free speech and I only asked questions. Socrates also did that but I am not into drinking hemlock as much as you apparently wish I would.</p></blockquote>

<p>This one really brings a smile to my face.  You're right - it's free speech and I wouldn't in the least want to suppress it.  I would just hope that a minister would have greater respect for the diversity that his Lord created than to badger another one his brothers.</p>

<p>And the Socrates allusion.  Please.  You think too much of my opinion of you.</p>

<blockquote><p>As far as the Crusades and edicts of Popes go, I would fight against them both with all my heart. This comparison you make implies that it's ok for the Muslims to be doing as they are because Christians and Jews did the same thing in their history. This is a view I think you should rethink. Wrong does not excuse wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that's the answer I would be hoping for.  The fact that you would fight against them, that is.  My point was not that Christian and Jewish transgressions of yesterday excuse those of Muslims today, rather it was that all parties involved here have violent histories.  Sometimes it is the extremists as is the case now, others it is the mainstream, as was the case during the Crusades.</p>

<p>British colonialism and later American containment of Communism hurt many Muslim countries through the 19th and 20th century and any distrust and/or hatred that comes out of that part of the world has been in part earned.  From our perspective, rather than attempting to convert Muslims as you feel called to do, I believe we need to figure out a way to embrace them, ask for forgiveness, and move forward showing them that we have changed our ways.  That, my dear sir, would be the Christian thing to do.</p>

<p>With such a strong point and positive note I want to end the bulk of my response.  The rest of your letter betrayed your pretence of piousness and showed your true arrogance.  Any response asking if a good Christian should pledge allegiance to a man-made institution contrary to Jesus' own instruction would be done to get "you really ... mad at me" and would lower the level of discussion so I will take the high road.</p>

<p>Shalom.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>... or require a public execution of them - a la the Taliban.</p>

<p>Maybe it's two steps, but please... censorship?  Ok, so the religious zealots of the day can't get creationism, I mean intelligent design, I mean "God put <strong>me</strong> here God Damnitism!" in the textbooks... so let's start taking books out of schools.  Interesting change in tactics.  One day they're trying to "expand" knowledge by providing alternative points of view, the next they're trying to take away access to knowledge.  </p>

<p>But I have an idea!  If they succeed in getting this passed, I think we should start an online petition to ban the Bible.  The book is full of adult content.  It has issues of morality, profanity (in ancient times), sexuallity, sexually explicit content, etc., etc.  We should not be subjecting our kids to this type of literature - as I write that, I can feel the blood boiling of Christians - "My Bible ain't 'literature'!"  And what about the boy Jewish or Muslim kids who find that Bible in the library and find themselves questioning their faith?  We shouldn't allow it!</p>

<p>Now, since I've never been inside a public school inside the Metro, can someone verify for me that the school libraries do have at least one copy of the Bible?  Of course, they may all be checked out so the <a href="http://www.templereport.com/archives/000501.html">Governor can take his oath on them</a>, but have they had them?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bluntwatch.info">Blunt Watch</a> has <a href="http://bluntwatch.info/archives/2005/01/12/million-dollar-inauguration/">a post</a> about the special lobbyist-only inauguration party, something jumped out at me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since Missouri <em>doesn?t require the disclosure of lobbying fees</em> we might never know how much the Blunt family will make off the affair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.  Does that seem right?  If I got elected to office, you could pay <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">my sister</a> a million dollars a year to lobby for your cause with the implication that her lobbying would involve calling me up and saying "brother, you should support this".  That's not right...</p>

<p>I'm still formulating my thoughts on this, but I think we need to push for a change in the lobbying laws in Missouri.  If you want election reform, how about publishing in real-time whose paying whom to speak for what.  The only way any politician could oppose such a seemingly obvious change in the rules would be because they've got some dirty laundry that might be aired, such as a sibling or other family member getting paid to lobby them.  Seems like one of the things I've heard/read about Blunt over the last few days is that he plans to make government more efficient and <em>transparent</em>.  What's more transparent than publishing in real-time who is "Them that's got the gold"?</p>

<p>Well, I just learned something.  Instead of making your point with words, 8 question marks can do the job.  I wish I would have known that, it would save me from being so verbose.  I wonder how you convey that many question marks in conversation though.  Hmm...</p>

<p>If you would like to ask for yourself, please feel free to drop Tracie (aka t. swicegood - the shift button apparently only works for question and exclamation marks, not those things like last names) a line at work - where she logged on from oddly enough.  I guess it's just me, but I find it ironic that she'd leave the comment complaining that I should "get a real job" while she's surfing at her office.  Hmm... I wonder what <a href="mailto:pineygroveelem@cms.k12.nc.us">Principal Flamer</a> would say to that obvious misuse of city property.  But I digress.  Send all correspondence to:</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's an interesting piece by way of <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drudge</a> about Kerry in the post-election.</p>

<p>Both sides are always misquoted - even I've been misquoted in papers - but if this is true, this is the most poignant part:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Kerry] wanted to show a letter from a schoolgirl that had been left on his stoop. The letter read, in part, "John Kerry, you're the greatest!" Kerry looked into the reporter's eye. "The pundits have never liked me," he said. "Is it the way I look? The way I sound?" He seemed vulnerable for a moment, then caught himself, smiled and walked home to his empty house.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Is it the way I look?  The way I sound?" - those are the words of a man <em>desperately</em> trying to figure out what went wrong...</p>

<p>The statement, which was posted on their website Wednesday alongside dozens of other archived "press releases," thanks God for the tsunami and for the death of any gay Swedish vacationers who perished at the time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Makes you want to move to Topeka doesn't it?  Thanks go to <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/about/tsunami-relief-and-the-homosexual-agenda-028637.php">Wonkette</a> for pointing this out.  As a funny side note, Westboro's website (which I am not linking to because it would help their Google rankings) seems to be down.  Apparently, their God hasn't seen fit to protect their server from the influx of traffic they've generated for themselves.  Guess he's <strike>own</strike> on vacation today.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<fieldset><legend>Editor's Note</legend>Below is an email sent to <a href="mailto:MissionGateMinistry@MSN.com">Rick Mathes</a>.  He's the author of an Allah or Jesus article.  For commentary on the article and the full text, please <a href="http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/rickmathes.html">visit BreakTheChain.org's article</a>.  Feel free to copy this all, or in part, and <a href="mailto:MissionGateMinistry@MSN.com">email it to Rick</a> yourself.</fieldset>

<p>Mr. Mathes,</p>

<p>I just received an email this morning which I honestly thought was a fake.  Whenever I receive something like this, I run a few web searches to determine it's validity.  I was appalled to find that there was an actual minister with enough ignorance of world faiths to write something like this.</p>

<p>Just to make sure your "24 emails in favor of the article to 1 against" for your ignorant article on Islams stays somewhere about the same, I wanted to registered with you my displeasure in the article you wrote.</p>

<p>One section I would like you to particularly reflect on:</p>

<blockquote><p>I then said, ?Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Pat Robertson or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven.?</p></blockquote>

<p>I ask you to look at the Crusades - was the ruthless massacre of Muslims not only ordered, but endorsed by the sitting pope?  And what about a certain Baptist minister in Kansas whose church's website touts the number of days that Matthew Shepard has been in hell?  Are both of these not examples of religions touting the killing of those contradictory to their faith?  And look to the Old Testament, is it not filled with "God's people" committing murder and sacking towns in the name of reclaiming what is theirs?</p>

<p>Quite honestly, I don't expect a response to this email.  The fact that you would not take the time to respond to BreakTheChain.org who was obviously trying to discredit you shows the extent of your convictions.  Just the same, I felt this needed to be said.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok... as if sucking down an inordinate amount of gas, taking up too much on the road, and just generally be in the way wasn't reason enough to hate some <em>SUV drivers</em> - now they're literally <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/07/boys.hit.ap/index.html">running people over</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A woman ran over two teenage brothers after they <em>accidentally</em> hit her sport utility vehicle with a golf ball they were bouncing in a parking lot, officials said. One of the boys suffered life-threatening injuries. - <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/07/boys.hit.ap/index.html">CNN Story</a>, Emphasis mine.</p></blockquote>

<p>And you thought <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/22/i_m_a_militant_suv_hater">I was kidding</a> when talking about nearly being run over.  </p>

<p>We should really require some sort of counseling for these drivers before we just let these people go spend $40k on a ride like this.  You know, similar to the type of counseling they receive before getting a penis/breast enlargement. ;)</p>

<p>Happened to me last night.  <a href="http://bikelights.com/Products/Arc.htm">L&amp;M ARC's</a> will cut to half power at 60 seconds to go.  1:11 (I wasn't on a fully battery) in to my ride last night, I'm going along at pretty good pace through the TNT trail (about where the southern most T-N-T is on the map) on my way out to the car and boom - my light dims.  I was only about 15 minutes away from the car via the trail, and thankfully the moon was shinning 'cause I didn't have any backup light.  It's amazing how much of an effect clouds have on moon light.  It was starting to get partly cloudy toward the end of the ride, so I got to see the full effect of it.  If you're out there over the next few days and see some footprints that look like <a href="http://www.sidiusa.com/mtbs/images/mtbs-big/2005_dominator5lor_blackbla.jpg">Sidi's</a> with <a href="http://www.sidiusa.com/parts-access/index.html">toe spikes</a>, that's me! :)</p>

<p>I'll be headed to the store real soon to by an LED headlamp :)  Any suggestions?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After receiving a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/12/reading_notes_chapter_6_the_intimately_o#c120">comment</a> on a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/12/reading_notes_chapter_6_the_intimately_o">post</a> of mine earlier this week, I've been keeping an eye on <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/">The Superficial Plaza Chick</a>.  She's got some hilarious stuff, but <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/2004/12/fellas-wax-back-hair-not-legs.html">one post</a> required a response...</p>

<p>In <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/2004/12/fellas-wax-back-hair-not-legs.html">Fellas: <strong>Wax</strong> back hair, <strong>Not</strong> legs</a>, she launches into this whole thing on guys shaving.  The post itself sounds to me like the problem was more with the guy than the shaving of his legs.</p>

<blockquote><p>I've also noticed that men who shave their legs are insanely perfectionistic about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok, I've noticed that too, but generally only amongst guys who just started shaving their legs.  If it doesn't wear off, then it's probably because that person has that type of personality.  Seeing as how her point of reference for men who shave their legs was a body-builder, I'm going to guess that he was the "perfectionistic" type.  You would have thought the constant measuring of each item of food, the religious training schedule, and other such peculiarities of a "body builder" would have keyed her into this personality trait, but apparently it took the leg shaving...</p>

<p>At this point, I guess it would be good to fill you in on how I'd know so much about the topic of male leg shaving.  I'm a cyclist, and at one point was a pretty fast mountain biker.  Contrary to the popular belief that it makes you go faster, shaving your legs is done to speed the healing process.  This is more of an issue in mountain biking, where falls can be a pretty common thing.  Once you get competitive in racing, you're pushing your body as hard as it can go and shutting your brain off except for the need-to-know stuff.  From time to time, you'll over or under estimate a rock, drop, corner, something... and you're going down.  I've seen it as all levels.  Actually, beginners and the slower sports usually don't get hurt because they're so cautious.  Part of being fast is taking risks that those starting out won't.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  </p>

<p>Either way, when you're picking rocks, thorns, and other things out of your legs, hair just gets in the way.  I lived in the desert prior to KC, and one thing you constantly had to watch out for was cacti.  The quickest way to get prickly pear thorns out of your legs (or other body parts) was to put some sort of tape (duct worked best) across it and pull.   Sort of like waxing your legs.  Try doing that with a leg full of hair...  No thanks.</p>

<p>Back to the point about guys and shaving their legs.  In cycling when someone starts <strike>they're</strike> they tend to be pretty "perfectionistic" about it.  To quote one of the girls I used to ride with while we were talking to another recent "convert" to the shaved leg cult, "I've never even used that much stuff..."  He was listing all of the products he'd tried to keep his legs from burning.  I think most women <em>have</em> used that much stuff, but they went through it so long ago they don't even remember.  If they think back to when they first started shaving their legs, I'll bet they were just as obsessed with it getting it perfect.  Guys that start shaving their legs seem so obsessed is just because of the newness of it.  It wears off after a few months or so.</p>

<p>So girls, don't freak out if your guy starts shaving his legs.  If he rides a bike, there is a rhyme to the reason.  Now if you're just worried about "him emerg[ing] from the shower with legs smoother than [yours]", well that might just be a personal problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>You must first lay it down for a Foundation in general, That there is Inequality in Sexes, and that for the better Oeconomy of the World; the Men, who were to be the Law-givers, had the larger share of Reason bestow'd upon them; by which means your Sex is the better prepar'd for Compliance that is necessary for the performance of those Duties which seem'd to be most properly assign'd to it....  Your Sex wanteth our Reason for your Conduct, and our Strength for your Protection: Ours wanteth your Gentleness to soften, and to entertain us....</p></blockquote>

<li>Religion is exactly what a woman needs, for it givers her that dignity that best suits her dependence.</li>
<li>Religion is just what woman needs.  Without it she is ever restless or unhappy.</li>
<li>A professor admonished one girl for admiring non-traditional clothing by saying that they are "only one of the many manifestations of that wild spirit of socialism and agrarian radicalism which is at present so rife in our land." <em>And you thought blaming something out of the mainstream on an "enemy of the state" was something new.</em></li>
<li>True feminine genius is ever timid, doubtful, and clingingly dependent; a perpetual childhood. <em>The reverse of that is that it is genius - by portraying a "perpetual childhood", a woman could easily manipulate 99% of the men out there.</em></li>
<li>Rules for Conjugal and Domestic Happiness warned "Do not expect too much."</li></ul>
<p><em>What's really said is that I've read posts this year on "Christian" forums debating a "woman's place".  Many of the comments, from men and women alike, sound an awful lot like these quotes.</em></p></li>
<li>[Angelina Grimke's] talk attracted a huge crowd, and a representative from Salem proposed that "a Committee be appointed to examine the foundations of the State House of Massachusetts to see whether it ill bear another lecture from Miss Grimke!" <em>pg 121.4</em></li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>All communities divide themselves into the few and the many.  The first are the rich and well-born, the other the mass of the people.  The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, <strong>it is not true in fact</strong>.  The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.  Give therefore to the first class a distinct permanent share in the government.... Can a democratic assembly who annually revolve in the mass of the people be supposed steadily to pursue the public good?  Nothing but a permanent body can check the imprudence of democracy.... <em>pg 96.1 Emphasis mine - attributed to Alexander Hamilton.  It's a good thing he didn't actually hold an office of any importance, like that of a cabinet member of anything.  Oh wait!  He did...</em></li>
<li>...Federalist Paper #63 argued the necessity of a "well-constructed Senate" as "sometimes necessary as a defence to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions" because "there are particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn."  And: "In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?" <em>pg 98.2 - sounds an awful lot like a beneficient <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=big%20brother">Big Brother</a>.  Bare in mind that these words were penned when the Senate was not elected, but rather appointed by state legislatures.</em></li></ul>

<p>Zinn closes out this chapter with an interesting take on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights">Bill of Rights</a>.  As is the case with the entire book, he takes a contrarian point-of-view: the <em>Bill of Rights</em> isn't there to necessarily gaurantee rights, but rather to give the appearance of them.  He points to the <a href="http://www.law.ou.edu/hist/sedact.html">Sedition Act of 1798</a>, enacted by now <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/ja2.html">President John Adams</a> and one in the same with the defender of British troops in the Boston Massacre, as a prime example of this.  This restriction on the First Ammendment, and others that followed, weren't challenged until the first part of the 20th century.  As recently as 1951, the Supreme Court upheld Congress' right to infringe upon our First Ammendment right if it presented a "clear and present danger".  <em>Note: Wikipedia was used in addition to <strike>the</strike> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0060528427%3Fv%3Dglance">A People's History</a> as the <strike>base</strike> <em>basis for</em> these comments.</em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just came across what started as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/arts/05rich.html?oref=login&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position=">good article</a> by Frank Rich at NYTimes.com.  The idea is that Brain Williams is not an anchorman out for a story, but out for an audience.  I agree - nearly all TV news is done that way.  "It's the [ratings], stupid."</p>

<p>But then Rich just showed his general contempt for all things not ordained by the almighty Times - he turned his wrath toward blogs.  Bloggers are apparently right-wing, wannabe pundints with so few journalism skills as to make a monkey with a typewriter a more fair, balanced reporter.</p>

<p>I have to chuckle at this guys seeming oblivion to the rest of the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>And so network news still counts. The idea, largely but not exclusively fomented by the right, that TV news might somehow soon be supplanted by blogging as a mass medium may remain a populist fantasy until Americans are able to receive blogs by iPod. (At which point they become talk radio.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Hey Franky boy, it's call <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=podcasting">podcasting</a>. If I realy wanted to rub his face in exactly how out of touch he really is, I'd mention something about Googling his <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Frank%20Rich%22">all-important name</a> and the results versus Googling <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=podcasting">podcasting</a>, but I don't want to be that mean.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/hill/daily-briefing-run-for-four-years-026719.php">Wonkette</a> for turning me on to the story.</em></p>

        <title>Iran: Now you see it, now you don't... wait, there it is again</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/11/30/iran_now_you_see_it_now_you_don_t_wait_t/"/>
        <updated>2004-11-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/11/30/iran_now_you_see_it_now_you_don_t_wait_t</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Is anyone ever going to trust the Iranians again?  Seriously?  One minute they won't back down.  "Allah created nuclear power, therefore we should be able to use it to power our cities and vanquish the infidels."*  The next minute they have their tail tucked between legs running to the Europeans trying to get a deal to keep the UN Security Council from hearing about their nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>Now - today the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4054069.stm">BBC reports</a> that they're gloating that they "isolat[ed] the US.  And that is a great victory for us."  Now they're saying that the suspension of urianium enrichment is only going to last as long as the talks with the EU continue.  "We are talking months, not years," as he so eloquently put.  I think more properly translated into English that would be "We'd hate to see anything <em>bad</em> happen...  Let's keep talking about it and figure out how these bad guys could cause a problem.  Here, you buy lunch for it."  It's an old fashion shake-down of the EU.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4054069.stm">article</a> also mentions the following quote from Rohani:</p>

<blockquote><p>He added that the US representative at the IAEA meeting in Vienna "was enraged and in tears, and everybody said that the Americans had failed and we had won".</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure exactly who he's talking about, <strike>I</strike> within the last few weeks I saw a presentation of the <a href="http://www.npec-web.org/">Nonproliferation Policy Education Center</a>.  The guy wasn't crying, but was visibly shaken - depressed might be a better word - at the possibility of Iran becoming a nuclear power.  The general idea is that the current nuclear powers are in check.  The super-powers have them and all of the smaller countries that have them are under the influence of one or more of the super-powers.  Iran on the other hand would upset the balance.</p>

<p>Oh - one other thing.  The inspections that the UN might be doing wouldn't matter a damn bit.  If Iran gets a <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/ligwat.html">light water reactor</a> they could produce enough weapons grade uranium within 60 days to build several missiles.  Surely in two months the inspectors would know what's up, right?  Wrong, the inspections would happen every 90 days.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/11/27/hello_cyberspace</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow.  It has been over a week since I've posted anything.  Longer than that since I posted anything of any consequence or which was posted for the sake of posting.  <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws">Other sites</a> have gone a month without any updates.  It's amazing the guilt trip a blog can put on you.  Simply loading it and seeing that your stats are remaining high while you do nothing can make you feel like a bad blogmaster.  Well, maybe not... but it sure sounds good :)</p>

<p>Work has kept me too busy to write much.  What little free time I've had has been spent biking or working on bikes, or getting over a cold.  A little over a week ago I came down with a horrible cold and today is the first day that I've felt really good the entire day.  It is truly amazing how much you can be affected when just one little virus gets loose in your body.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm going to call it an evening and retire to a book.  I picked up Stephen Hawking's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F076241698X%2Fqid%3D1101615038%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_ka_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">On the Shoulders of Giants</a> this evening.  It contains the English translations of Copernicus' <em>On the Revolution of Heavenly Spheres</em>, Galilei's <em>Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences</em>, Kepler's <em>Harmony of the World</em> Book Five, Newton's <em>Principia</em> and selections of Einstein's <em>The Principle of Relativity</em>.  I was looking for an good science book to read, so I figured why not read some of the texts that lay the foundation for all modern physics.  Throw in a bonus commentary and introduction by <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/">Hawking</a> and I figure it should be good.  As always, I'll post any commentary on the book here.</p>

<p>And I'll leave you with one quote from <em>On the Revolution of Heavenly Spheres</em>' Introduction.  Bear in mind that the final text was edited without Copernicus' guidance, but just the same, from the little bit I do know of this Polish priest, this does sound like something he might have penned for fear of being branded a heretic.</p>

<blockquote><p>... let no one expect anything in the way of certainty from astronomy, since astronomy can offer us nothing certain, lest, if anyone take as true that which has been constructed for another use, he go away from this discipline a bigger fool than when he came to it.</p></blockquote>

<p>If only the modern sciences were presented with such humility...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know, there are a lot of stupid laws on the books.  It seems that some of the laws that would just seem common sense are left out.</p>

<p>Did you know that there is little or no recourse if a bounty hunter "arrests" you <strike>can</strike> because they think you're someone else?  That's the case:</p>

<blockquote><p>Without legal pressure,  Benson said, ?Nobody is going to take responsibility for this.?</p></blockquote>

<p>"Benson" refers to Arthur A. Benson II, an attorney representing Richard Allen Sexton.  According to the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/10169288.htm?1c">Star</a>, Sexton was mistaken for Richard <em>Alan</em> Sexton and arrested by a band of bounty hunters.  His recourse?  Nothing really.  There's no law holding bounty hunters liable for mistaking someone's identity.</p>

<p>Seems ludicrous...</p>

        <title>Perry and Fancy Creek MTB Trails</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/11/09/perry_and_fancy_creek_mtb_trails/"/>
        <updated>2004-11-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/11/09/perry_and_fancy_creek_mtb_trails</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First off, I would like to thank both <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/trails/trail.php?s=ks&amp;file=perry.xml">Lyle</a> and <a href="http://www.kansasmountainbiking.com/">Nate</a>.  They are great ambassadors of the sport and have both put together some great riding opportunities through trails they maintain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn't get to ride all of the trails out at <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/trails/trail.php?s=ks&amp;file=perry.xml">Perry</a> but what I did ride was a blast.  It's not too rocky, but not too smooth either... It's a Goldilocks trail: just about right, but I'm sure most everybody from around KC knows that.</p>

<p>The one you might not know about is <a href="http://www.kansasmountainbiking.com/local_trails.html">Fancy Creek</a>.  The terrain reminded me a lot of central and northeastern New Mexico.  Thick with evergreens and a mix of rich black soil, pine needles, and rocks to make for some fun trails.  The cover is so thick in parts of the trail that you can hear riders on the trail 20' to either side of you and not see them.</p>

<p>I think Nate's right, once you get past Perry this has to be the best trail until you hit the Rockies.  If you've got to drive to Denver, or just want to hit some trails that are a bit different, keep Fancy Creek high on your list of trails to ride.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You get to choose between two of our nation's finest.  The choice is clear.  On one side you can choose a candidate who is crippled by incomprehension; on the other, you can choose a candidate who is crippled by indecision.  So take an hour off of work and go stand in a line so you can go do you meaningless patriotic duty!  Go tell your electoral college member how to vote for the next President of the United States!</p>

<p>(<em>Author's note</em>: Sometimes I really do wonder when I became such a cynic.)</p>

<p>On another note, if you haven't voted yet and would just vote for Question 1 because of the arts - don't.  The Performing Arts Center is already paid for!  That's why you would only see it in the background at the booths at the Plaza Art Fair and such.  This is also the reason the drawings weren't used in the TV commercials.  I'm sorry, but this is a quarter of a billion dollar money grab by the two sports teams.  It's dirty politics to put the "Arts" in there with this question - they knew if they had two questions the arts would pass and the sports would fail, but throw it all together and you might just get 'em both.  I don't think we should be given an itemized budget to vote on, but I think there's a difference between tailgating and watching the symphony.</p>

<p>And finally, am I the only one that considers the following incomprehensible blabber?</p>

<blockquote><p>Should the Charter of Kansas City be amended by repealing various sections and enacting new sections to read as provided in Second Committee Substitute for Ordinance No. 040924, As Amended, to remove certain operational mandates and to permit the City Council to adopt ordinances to regulate these areas?</p></blockquote>

<p>What the fuck does that mean? <em>[Edit] Yes, I understand that it means that certain parts of the Charter would be changed as the Second Committee requested.  I'm posing this as a deeper question, what am I amending?  You know, the stuff that ballots might just be expected tell you.[/Edit]</em>  I really wish they had a "Yes/No/Ask me again when you can actually explain what you want".  I know, I should have been informed on what it meant, but really...  "as provided in Second Committe Substitute for Ordinance No. 040924".  Yeah, that means a lot to anyone who didn't actually write it.  How 'bout this - why not provide both the old version and the suggested new version.  Whoa... what an idea!  Fill the voter in when they vote!</p>

<p>You know, this is another argument for electronic voting.  A properly created electronic voting system could easily provide all of the additional information and context a voter could want.  Allow every candidate to submit a paragraph explaining their positions and allow both the for and againsts to provide a paragraph explaining why you should back their amendment.</p>

<p>But then you might actually have informed voters!  Hell, the fact that the parties have to put up with voters in the first place is nuisance enough, why actually let them know what they're voting for.</p>

<p>AOL has consistently resisted the Internet - their email being a prime example.  Until recently all AOL email sent from AOL to a non-AOL email address was rendered in plain-text.  The reason?  AOL refused to use HTML/RTF to format email messages per the Internet standard - instead, they used their own proprietary methods.</p>

        <title>ER meeting update</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/10/21/er_meeting_update/"/>
        <updated>2004-10-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/10/21/er_meeting_update</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Just posted this to the <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/mid-america-mtb">Earthrider's mailing list</a>.  I know there's a few bikers who read my blog, so I thought I'd post it here, too</em></p>


<p>Howdy all,</p>

<p>Well, since no one else has ponied up, here's a quick rundown of what happened last night:</p>

<p>* Trail maintenance update: Just an overview of some of the projects planned this winter.  EarnYourDirt.com has all the info on what's happening, and when and where.  My understanding of it is that it'll be the point of contact for people to find out what's going on.  There's also a local phone # that will contain the most current updates on trail maintenance workdays (including cancellations).  I left the # at the house, but I'm sure someone else can post it here for everyone.  It would probably be good to have that number listed on the website, too.</p>

<p>* Ozark trails: There's some new trails going in at the Ozarks.  Official trail work is schedule to start in February.  ERTA has received a sizable grant to go towards equipment for building these trails.  Once the trails are finished, all of the equipment purchased will stay with ERTA so we get the benefit of them from here on out.  The catch is that we have to put in 3,000 hours working on the trails in order to qualify for the grant.  Travel time does count, so a 4 hour work day turns into an 8 hour credit toward the grant.</p>

<p>* New Trails: In addition to shoring up a few stretches of existing trail, the majority of this seasons trail work will be done building new trails.  All totaled - there's going to be over 100 miles of new trail put in or started this winter.  That blew me away...</p>

<p>* Awards: Sean Cairns was given a pretty cool looking bike (of the mantel variety) for all of work he's put in for Earthriders over the past few years.</p>

<p>* Food stamps (coupons really): Posson posted about this a few days ago - they had their Price Chopper coupon books in.  From what I saw, they went over pretty well.  Just about everyone I saw bought one.  It's basically a no-cost way to give $4 to ERTA - the books cost $5, $4 of which goes back to ERTA, and the next time you spend $50 at Price Chopper/HyVee you get $5 off.  Also, if you have a Price Chopper card, 1% of your purchases can be donated back to ERTA.  They can take care of registering for us, but I'm not sure who they would be - some else can fill in the email address.  :)   The money that's raised from both of these will be going into purchase signs for area trails.  Which leads into...</p>

<p>* Signs and correct trail maps: When you know the trails you're riding, you don't even think of there not being any signs on the trails.  We're in a situation at Crowder, though, where we can't build any new trails until everything that is there is properly marked.  This serves two purposes.  First, it helps newcomers to the sport and area find their way around and make sure they're on trails that match their ability.  Second, it helps rescue personal if there's every a problem and they need to get someone off of the trail network.  It's one thing for us bikers to be able to find our way around and know all of the trail names, but without proper signage and maps rescue teams could spend hours trying to locate someone who's injured.<br />
I think that just about covers everything.  I'm doing this from memory, so I'm sure I missed something(s).  If you wanted more detail though you should have come! :)</p>

<p>On a personal note, it was great to see all of the positive activity with trails and access to trails in the region.  I moved here last fall from a place that just this past summer lost access to one of it's prime mountain biking locations due to urban sprawl.  A lot of time and energy was spent last year trying to insure access to just a small portion of that land most of which wouldn't have been necessary had the "founding fathers" done what is being done here and insure proper access from the start.  To hear talk about 25 year agreements to insure mountain bike access and numbers like 100 miles of new trail is really great.  If last night was any indication, Kansas City mountain bikers are going to continue to have some excellent mountain biking opportunities for a long time to come.  Thanks to all of you who are working to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>If anyone's up for a night ride, me and a few guys are going to meet up at the Smithville "W Trails" tonight assuming it just stays hazy and doesn't start raining.  We'll be rolling out 6:30'ish.  You can reach me at this email until about 5 or by phone at 816-260-7606 if you want to know if the ride's still on tonight.</p>

<p>Kansas City residents have a new resource for politics, hearings, and whatnot from around the metro at <a href="http://kccouncilwatch.blogspot.com/">KC Council Watch</a>.  To quote Joe's site, he started it because:</p>

<blockquote><p> I'm just a concerned citizen who wants to know more about what's going on with local politics.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a great site, lots of quick info that makes it easy to digest what's going on in the governments around the metro.  Two things I wish he would do to it though:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Add an RSS/Atom feed</strong> - I'm lazy... I don't like going to sites to see what's going on, I want my feedreader to do it for me :)</li>
<li><strong>Re-license the site under Creative Commons</strong> - Ok, so I'm an <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>-activist, but hopefully once Joe gets involved in blogging he'll see the light and re-license under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">Creative Commons license</a> so others can quote him as I just did without fear of "infringement".</li></ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, well not really, but I'm getting close.</p>

<p>It's geeky, I know, but from time to time I can't help but going to Google and Yahoo and putting in "Travis Swicegood" and seeing what happens.  Since I know you've been waiting all of 30 seconds to find out how I'm king of the world, here's the official results:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">Google Number - 3,460</a></li>
<li><a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">Yahoo Number - (make sure you're sitting down) 12,600</a></li></ul>

<p>Apparently, Yahoo likes me better.  Just to put these numbers in context.  <a href="http://blog.contentious.com/">Amy Gahran</a>'s Google/Yahoo #'s are 13,100 and 13,100; <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com">Lee LeFever</a>'s Google/Yahoo #s are 4,200 and 5,310.</p>

<p>So what's the secret of my success?  Welp, every time someone install<em class="edit">s</em> the <a href="http://www.b2evolution.net">b2evolution</a> blog and doesn't update their blog-roll, a link to me via "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">Travis Swicegood Hosting</a>" goes up.  For the real numbers, run <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22%20-%20%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">this Google search</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22%20-%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">this Yahoo search</a>.  Neither of them are bad, but there's still a big gap.  It also shows how quickly Yahoo is gathering results on the Internet.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may see this over in the "What I'm Reading..." bar on the left, but I thought I'd mention it here too so you can offer comments on it:</p>

<blockquote><p>About 800 members of the 98th Army Reserve Division from Rochester, New York will begin a year-long mission in Iraq next month.</p>

<p>The unit, which normally trains reserve and active-duty soldiers in the U.S., will find itself training Iraq?s new army.</p>

<p>The 98th is a non-combat unit that doesn't even have its own weapons or vehicles.</p>

<p>"This is a hard war and we, frankly, inside the Army Reserve have been not properly prepared for it,? said Lt. Gen. James Helmly, chief of the U.S. Army Reserve.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wonder if this is real.  Surely Bush will have a good explanation to this, because I would be floored if Kerry doesn't bring it up as part of the "wrong" plan in Iraq.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might notice the two new additions to my site.  Over on the <strike>left</strike> right I've added the <em>Free Technology</em> block that links to <a href="http://savebetamax.org/">SaveBetamax.org</a>.  This is a group who's mobilizing the effort to defeat the bill formerly known as the <a href="http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/004563.html">INDUCE Act</a>.  If you haven't heard of the INDUCE Act before, it's a bill that was introduced by the movie/recording industries very own "Senator in a Pocket" - Orrin Hatch - that would hold the developer of technology liable if they produce anything that could be used to infringe upon copyrights.  The link to Betamax should be making sense right about now.  The movie industry fought the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax">Betamax</a> because it was unfair that technology could record and make copies of their movies without them having any control over it...  Wait, doesn't that sound like the recording industry now?  How the times never change...</p>

<p>What really gets under my skin on this is that it will have a very chilling effect on my vocation.  Let's say I make blog tool.  Technically, someone who was so minded could use my software creation to plagurize an entire book.  All of the suden, I'm liable for that plagurization.  Nevermind that there are thousands of other users who don't break the law - because that one or two I'm in bankruptcy court.</p>

<p>Second up is the change of "Where I'm at..." to "What I'm reading...".  I haven't used <a href="http://del.icio.us/tswicegood">del.icio.us</a> since I <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/newmedia?p=103&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">discovered Furl</a>.  This is just a list of articles and pages that I've found useful or interesting.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you in the know, the Hughtrain has some witty insights.  For those of you who aren't, you should check out his latest "work".  He has a complete - being it's all there but still being tweaked and added to from time to time - version of his <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html">How to be Creative</a>.  It's available in both the <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html">long</a> and <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000876.html">short</a> version.  The short gets the bare points across, the long expands on them.</p>

<p>I will warn you, this may not be work appropriate if you happen to work in one of those places where the use of "inappropriate" language is frowned upon.  If you do happen to work in one of those places, you <strong>really need</strong> to read this...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The long version has 26 drawings.  Even if you don't read the whole 10,000 word essay, it's worth a look just to check out the pictures.  Here's a few of my favorites:</p>

<ul><li>The price of being a sheep is boredom<br />
The price of being a wolf is loneliness.<br />
Choose one or the other with great care.<br />
<a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000897.html">You are Responsible for your own Experience</a></li>
<li>(drawing: two circles, X and Y, they overlap to form a smaller Z)<br />
x: full of ideas<br />
y: full of shit<br />
z: full of shit ideas<br />
<a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000891.html">I'd like my crayons back, please</a></li>
<li>I do the work for free<br />
I get paid to be afraid<br />
<a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000906.html">Where to Draw the Red Line</a></li></ul>

<p>That last one really carries a lot of meaning.  I hope I don't get to that point.  Anyhow, <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html">read the article</a> for yourself.</p>

<h3>
<a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html">The 25 points to being creative</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>1. Ignore everybody.</p>

<p>2. The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to change the world.</p>

<p>3. Put the hours in.</p>

<p>4. If your biz plan depends on you suddenly being "discovered" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail.</p>

<p>5. You are responsible for your own experience.</p>

<p>6. Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten.</p>

<p>7. Keep your day job.</p>

<p>8. Companies that squelch creativity can no longer compete with companies that champion creativity.</p>

<p>9. Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb.</p>

<p>10. The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.</p>

<p>11. Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether.</p>

<p>12. If you accept the pain, it cannot hurt you.</p>

<p>13. Never compare your inside with somebody else's outside.</p>

<p>14. Dying young is overrated.</p>

<p>15. The most important thing a creative person can learn professionally is where to draw the red line that separates what you are willing to do, and what you are not.</p>

<p>16. The world is changing.</p>

<p>17. Merit can be bought. Passion can't.</p>

<p>18. Avoid the Watercooler Gang.</p>

<p>19. Sing in your own voice.</p>

<p>20. The choice of media is irrelevant.</p>

<p>21. Selling out is harder than it looks.</p>

<p>22. Nobody cares. Do it for yourself.</p>

<p>23. Worrying about "Commercial vs. Artistic" is a complete waste of time.</p>

<p>24. Don't worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.</p>

<p>25. You have to find your own schtick.</p></blockquote>

        <title>Why marginalize?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Marginalizing a view that differs from yours is quick and easy.  But like most things quick and easy - fast food, promiscuous sex, and <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/28/shady_telemarketers">fast-talking telemarketers</a> - it isn't good for you.  </p>

<p>You object to my forwarding you an email on <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_gw_bush_john_3_16.htm">Dubya's favorite Bible verse 16:3</a>, you have to be a gun-totin', Bible thumpin', Jesus fearin' Republican (read with extra emphasis on "Re").  </p>

<p>You didn't think my <a href="http://www.georgiaheritagecoalition.org/site2/x-files/image-flush-johns.php">Flush the Johns</a> email was hilarious, no doubt you're a snooty, latte-liberal driving your kids to soccer practice in your Volvo all the while complaining about the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/22/i_m_a_militant_suv_hater">SUV's that hog the road</a>.  </p>

<p>You support legalizing drugs?  Pothead!</p>

<p>You support keeping drugs illegal?  Holier-than-thou facist!</p>

<p>Allow gay marriage?  Homo!</p>

<p>Ban gay marriage?  Religious nutball! (author's note: <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5">I'm kinda guilty</a> - I've never called someone a religious nutball, but I have thought it from time to time.)</p>

<p>You don't want me driving an SUV?  Tree hugging, environmental terrorist!</p>

<p>You think we should protect the oil pipelines in Iraq?  Yeah, so your Cheneyburton stock will go up!</p>

<p>It's easier to compartmentalize and marginalize.  It requires less effort.  Knee jerk reactions are easier, but they are just that: reactions.  To the logical - dare I say, <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/14/take_back_liberal">liberal</a> - mind, these statements are equally ignorant and only succeed in marginalizing those who think differently.  </p>

<p>This September 12th, honor the memory of those who died three years and one day ago today by remembering that with the freedom you so proudly cherish to say what you want, think what you want, and email what you want comes responsibility.  Make sure you aren't just reacting.  Make sure you are contributing.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>4 years, 8 years, it doesn't matter how many years pass.  John Edwards is running for office.  It's unbelievably close.  The only way for someone mounting a campaign against him to be successful is one final blow in the closing week of the campaign.  Think of this commercial:</p>

<blockquote><p>Screen to black with white writing (small, but not illegible) stating "Paid for by Mike the Candidate"</p>

<p>"I'm Mike the Candidate, and I approved this message"</p>

<p>Full black screen.</p>

<p>Full screen shot of John Edwards saying speaking to reports:</p>

<p>"...if you go to the polls in November and elect anyone other than us, and another terrorist attack occurs, then it's your fault..."</p>

<p>Screen freezes, rewinds, and repeats slowed.</p>

<p>Screen freezes, rewinds, and repeats very drawn out.</p>

<p>Voice over: Do you want un-American threats like this from your -insert office-?</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfair?  Definitely.  Taken out of context?  It is not only taken out of context, but context exists on a different plane for this, but...  You could successfully run a smear campaign on John Edwards in the last week of a campaign with that statement.  Here's the full text of what he said <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/07/cheney.terror/">according to CNN</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Edwards told reporters that "Dick Cheney's scare tactics crossed the line."</p>

<p>"What he said to the American people was that if you go to the polls in November and elect anyone other than us, and another terrorist attack occurs, then it's your fault," Edwards said during a stop in Chillicothe, Ohio.</p></blockquote>

<p>You'll notice I left out the part about him talking about Dick Cheney, but so would anyone else who would use this tactic.  In my opinion, John Edwards just showed that he truly is a freshman Senator.  How in the world could he give the Republicans that soundbyte?  And it plays perfect as a stand alone sentence.  "If you go to the polls in November and elect anyone other than us, and another terrorist attack occurs, then it's your fault!"  I caught that much of it on the news last night and had to find the whole quote for myself.  It sounded just like he was saying "If you don't vote for John 1 and John 2, you got what you deserve."  How could his advisors let him say anything closely resembling that.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>100%, head over heels, can't go on living without the other kind of love.  You got it right!  Me - the one who will always maintain his independence and never become dependant upon another.  I've got a picture, but...</p>

<p><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/segway.jpg" border="0" alt="My new sweetheart" class="imgRight" />I'm not in it.</p>

<p>Had ya going there for a minute, didn't I?  Seriously though, this Segway contraption pictured on the right is unbelievably cool.  I was down at the <a href="http://www.segway.com/cgi-bin/dealers.cgi?zip=64151">Segway Store</a> - excuse me, the Segway <em>Experience</em> this afternoon and took one of this badboys for a spin.  It actually reminds me of flying.  The first time (well, the only time) I flew a plane it took me about 30 seconds to actually fly level.  It took about the same amount of time to actually stand still on a Segway.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't follow technology as if it will produce the next savior, a Segway is a self-balancing "human transporter" - their actual name is <em>Segway HT</em>.  Basically it works like this, there are two sensors in the platform you stand on.  The sensors detect where you are leaning and translate that into digital information that is interpetted and moves you around.  Lean forward, you move forward.  Lean backward, you move backward.  What happened when I first hopped on was an ever-so-slight rocking back and forth as I got my "Segway legs".  Once you get the hang of it, you can rocket around on 'em.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they are unbelievably cool.  If you want to make a programmer's day, feel free to fullfil my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/104-1170782-9247113?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;id=VYOSWBO3MIYH">Amazon Wish List's #1</a> request.</p>

<p>You know on second thought, I should have had my picture take on it...  They have a digital camera there at the store and will email you a photo.  Oh well, I'll have pictures enough of me zooming around on mine soon enough!</p>

<p>For the record before any rumors get started and I have to defend myself.  <strong>Yes,</strong> I did have a perma-grin as I started wheeling around on this and no, I'm not one bit ashamed... ;) </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Is there anything that President Bush could do to ensure his reelection in 2004? The venom of the Left...has relieved the President of any need to nail down his conservative supporters. They will be out en masse this November. The battle will instead be one of credibility on the war...</p></blockquote>

<p>These words were penned on ConservativeTruth.org in April.  They foretold what will happen this week at the convention.  If what I'm about to quote doesn't happen, Bush will have lost the election.  Moderates won't support him, he will be successfully vilified, Kerry will win.  Almost the rest of that quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>and there is one Republican who could provide instant and absolute credibility on this issue:</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok, I'm going to tease you a little more.  President Bush stands up in front of a receptive audience on Thursday night, and says.  "My fellow Americans, ... snipped for brevity ...  And I am proud to have <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> as my running mate."  So what words fill in the blanks?</p>

        <title>I'm a Militant SUV Hater</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/22/i_m_a_militant_suv_hater/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And I just realized it last night.  It's not that I hate SUVs because of what they do the environment: sending it to hell not in a hand basket, but as a FedEx overnight guaranteed delivery.  It's not because of what they do the economy: it can be argued that their guzzling of gas is one of the reasons gas is staying so high.</p>

<p>It is because, on average 9 times out of 10, the inconsiderate assholes who honk at me, pass to closely, or generally try to assert their <em>right</em> to the road while <strong>I am on my bike</strong> are driving their super inflated, ego driven, $40k metal with wheels replacement dick - an SUV!  </p>

<p>Last night it happened again.  I'm riding up 68th St and I hear a few vehicles coming up behind me, and "<em>Honk, honk...</em>"  I'm sorry, but when I'm on my bike and someone honks at me, they'd better have a bike rack on top of their car and a big friendly wave as they pass.  Did this guy?  Nope.  Instead, he passed getting his mirror within 6 inches of me and of course, an open lane beside him.</p>

<p>Consider this a warning all of your inconsiderate SUV assholes (if you drive an SUV, but don't happen to be an inconsiderate asshole, then you're ok): the next time you honk at me, don't stop at the next light that I might catch you at.  In case you didn't know, I'm wearing cleats and I'd hate to see how they would effect the paint your 3 ton metal dick.</p>

<p>/End Rant</p>

<p>I've <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/12/cycling_in_the_northland">blogged about this</a> before:</p>

<blockquote><p>The only thing that messes up this cycle-induced nirvana are the self-absorbed roadiacs ... who speed their souped up family sedans or quasi-military vehicles ... along with no care in the world about anyone else. "Hell, if I get in an accident, it ain't me that's going to get hurt. The momentum's with me and/or I'll just run 'em over."</p></blockquote>

        <title>Congratulations for the April Fool's baby</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/18/congratulations_for_the_april_fool_s_bab/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/18/congratulations_for_the_april_fool_s_bab</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess it's time I say something on my blog about this - I need everyone's help.  My sister and her husband are having a baby and I'm trying to "will" it to an April Fool's Day birthday.  I'm thinking if I get enough of you to help out, the blogosphere can make it happen just out of shear will. ;)</p>

<p>Seriously though, congratulations to the both of them.  It would be almost too ironic for them if their first baby was on April Fool's Day.  See, they got off to an oddball start by getting married on Leap Day back in February.  If the past is any predictor of the future, I may be on to something here with this April Fool's Day baby thing.  You see, when they first started talking about getting married, I said (sort of as a joke) "Why don't you do it on the 29th of February."  About a month later, I was attending the service on the 29th of February.  So...  My private comments of late when my sister told me the due date was roughly "March or April" were "All right, you're going to have an April Fool's Day baby."  The due date is just one week off so keep your fingers crossed! :)</p>

        <title>I found Pleasantville!</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/15/i_found_pleasantville/"/>
        <updated>2004-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/15/i_found_pleasantville</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a recent comment someone who would probably proudly declare themself part of the religious right made <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#c75">this remark</a>:</p>

<fieldset><legend><a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#c75">A recent comment on my site</a></legend>I'm packing up and going back to Pleasantville.....(a dear friend grew up in the North-East Pleasantville, I grew up in the Mid-West Pleasantville, and my step-mother-in-law grew up in the South-West Pleasantville)......it existed as surely as life today does.... I'm gonna find my way back.</fieldset>

<p>I've been racking my brain trying to figure out where Pleasantville was, but I think I figured it out.  Pleasantville doesn't really exist - it's a code word for <a href="http://www.christianexodus.com/">South Carolina</a>.  You see, a group of "Christian constitutionalists" is planning to set up shop in South Carolina with the intent of either receiving a "redress of grievances" or "call[ing] for a convention of the people and seek independence by 2016."  Looks like the Taliban would has some soul mates in the US.  Well, except <em>these</em> religious fanatics have it right, the Taliban were just devil spawn.</p>

<p>When you read their site, it would be easy to believe that it's just someone spoofing a site for the religious right to show how idiotic some of their "missions" are.  But, I'm afraid such is not the case.  They really are planning to attempt to take over South Carolina as their first place to a establish a Godly kingdom in the United States and return it to its Christian values.  Sorry, but I missed the part in the Bible where it talks about taking over the government <a href="http://www.christianexodus.com/index.php?module=PostWrap&amp;page=plan">10% at a time</a>.  At the risk of <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#comments">starting another holy war</a>, I did catch this verse:</p>

<fieldset><legend><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=MATT%2B22&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on&amp;language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;x=13&amp;y=11">Matthew 22:21-22</a></legend>Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.  When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</fieldset>

<p>Of course, I guess to these folks since God owns everything, it's only right they should "render" back to him this government he's so kindly lent us for the last 218 years.</p>

<p>So the next time someone tells you their headed back to Pleasantville, ask them if they really mean South Carolina.  Oh, and ask them if there are still limits on the colors of paint you can use. ;)</p>

        <title>Take back Liberal</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<fieldset><legend>liberal</legend>Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry.</fieldset>

<p>What happened to the word liberal?  When did it become a bad thing to be one?  I thought not limiting oneself was a good thing.  Keep an open mind - or at least that's what I was taught.</p>

<p>I was in a class setting with some older adults; a generation seperated us.  The discussion of being "liberal" came up.  There was a test that was supposed to gauge how conversative or liberal you were and several of the staunch Republicans were labeled as "liberal".  They were taken aback, but after reading the actual definition of liberal, they realized they were.  Not the liberal that the media and our politicians use - the one that has so much baggage with it - but truly liberal.  Free thinking.  Open to new ideas.  Not willing to take the common wisdom as gospel.</p>

<p>I think we need to take back the word liberal and clean up its image.  Being liberal, liberal-minded esspecially, is a good thing that should be encouraged.  What kind of message are we sending to the generations that come after us if being labeled a "liberal" meant you were part of the snobbery of the nation?  What kind of message are we sending right now to the rest of the world when our politicians run from the term liberal like the plague?</p>

I got to see Democratic Presidential Nominee, Senator <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">John Kerry</a> face-to-face tonight!  He ate at the <a href="http://www.herefordhouse.com/">Hereford House</a> in the Crossroads district.  As I was going back to my car, the police said he'd be out within the next 5 minutes.  5 turned in to 15, but I still got to meet him and wish him luck - as I would Nadar, Bush, or any other candidate for President.</p>

<p>My sister, who happened to be in town tonight on a surprise visit got to ask him about his plans for military.  On <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">her and her husband's blog</a>, she's been keeping track of some of the issues she's having with the military.  She asked the Senator what his plans were for military pay - did he plan on raising it.  He said yes, "and I'll tell you what else I'm going to do."  He then launched in to the increase the military, do away with "these crazy deployment schedules" and his normal stuff.  He talked with her for about 10 seconds, probably the longest time he took going through the line to answer any one in particular question.</p>

<p>She <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/index.php?title=what_are_the_chances&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">just posted about it on her blog</a>.  She also has a great picture I took of her talking with him - well, it's kind of blurry, but I shot it in the middle of the night on a dark street.  She's kind of long winded (runs in the family I guess), so it should be pretty detailed explaining what she thought of their encounter.</p>

        <title>The disenfranchised young vote?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/03/the_disenfranchised_young_vote/"/>
        <updated>2004-08-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/08/03/the_disenfranchised_young_vote</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Could it be that the young vote is being disenfranchised?  Who knows, but today I was turned away from the poll.  It's sort of my fault, but it's not.  You see, when I got my Missouri driver's license last November, I just assumed I would be registered to vote.  The assumption was my fault.  The fact that my voter's registration card didn't come didn't come as a shock - as a matter of fact I didn't even notice it until this last week.  But let's start at today...</p>

<p>On my way in to work, I decided to stop by the local polling station to vote.  Since I didn't have a voter's registration card, I knew I <em>might</em> not be listed, so I wanted to make sure I gave everyone plenty of time to get find the info before the polls closed today.  I went up to the appropriate line and handed my driver's license in.  A quick scan of the registrar showed no Travis Swicegood - my Dad was there and he went to got his license at the same time as me.  We actually went to get them at the same time so we could get our hunting licenses last fall, but that's a whole other story... back to today.  I explained that I thought I had been registered to vote last fall when I got my license.  With that, the election worker handed it off to the supervisor for that station.</p>

<p>He was an older man, very pleasant.  He said that the driver's license voter registration had turned in to a bigger hassle than he had expected.  When it first became law, he figured it would be a great way to get more people registered; instead it had just increased the bureaucracy.  With all of the different agencies involved, what used to be a straight forward process had to go from one office to the other to the other to the other and if one person along the way forgot to send something along a registration would get lost and only a call to Jeff City could remedy the situation.</p>

<p>He called the <a href="http://www.co.platte.mo.us/elections/">Platte City Board of Elections</a> to have them start the trace so I could vote.  After a brief explanation of what was going on - that he had someone with a local driver's license that wasn't on their books - he handed me phone.  I talked with Jennifer, who confirmed some information and took my phone number.  She called back about an hour later.</p>

<p>She said Jeff City didn't have any record of me as a registered voter.  When they pulled up my driver's license application, she said that "they had filled in "no" where it asks if you want to be registered to vote."  I told her that I had not been asked which didn't seem to sit well with her... almost in the "here we go, again" vein.  She went on to explain according to the federal election law passed in 1996 under Clinton, when I got my driver's license I was <em>supposed</em> to be asked "Are you registered to vote?" and "Do you want to be registered to vote?".  According my driver's license application, I had answered no to both.</p>

<p>I asked just to clarify that was the federal law that I be <em>asked</em> those questions, and she confirmed it for me.  She explained to me my options to make sure I could vote in the November election and told me to register at a library or court house so it would be witnessed, give it a few weeks, then call her back to make sure everything had gone through so this wouldn't happen again.  Like I said, she was very helpful... but I still don't get to vote today.</p>

<p>I was <strong>never</strong> asked if I had been registered to vote or whether I wanted to be registered to vote.  To say no to the first question is an outright lie on my part.  At the time, I was registered to vote in Texas.  To say no to the second...  Well I think anyone who reads this blog knows I wouldn't not vote.</p>

<p>What really threw me for a loop was Jennifer's initial statement that they had filled in "no" on my application.  It wasn't that I did it; it was that <em>they</em> did it.  Meaning my application didn't have my handwriting on it in places.  Personally, I think any non-administrative changes like that should have to be initialed to prove that you authorize the changes to the application.</p>

<p>I will be sending a link to this post to both the <a href="http://www.constitutiondefenseleague.org/">Constitutional Defense League</a> and the <a href="http://www.kcmo.org/mayor.nsf/web/home?opendocument">Mayor's office</a>.  I want it to be known that people who should have been registered to vote were being turned away.  It's not that big of a deal - if I'm the only one and there's no single vote victories.  But if there are more people like me out there, then the entire result of this election should be called in to question.</p>

The <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2004/by_state/MO_Page_0803.html?SITE=MOKASELN&amp;SECTION=POLITICS">Kansas City Star's election results</a> have had Amendment 2 floating between 60% and 70% all night.  I really get to feel like a minority today.  First I'm <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/03/the_disenfranchised_young_vote">denied my vote</a>, then I'm ideologically on the loosing side of a civil rights issue.</p>

<p>I guess I always get to hold out hope that one of those "<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#comments">rogue judges</a>" will find Amendment 2 unconstitutional...  Well, that is until certain groups find out that the constitution gives judges the authority to overturn laws that are unconstitutional.  Hell, we don't need 'em... There's no such thing as abuse of power by executive and legislative branches of government.  It's those damned legal types that keep messing things up.  Nevermind, I guess I won't hold out hope either...</p>

<p>This is a very discouraging evening to be living in Missouri.</p>

How are you making them feel when an alert goes out for the very area they're supposed to be working in?  The very area that they lost loved ones.  How do you answer when it's brought up that some of the data you've based this decision on was collected before you were even President?  What's taken so long?</p>

<blockquote><p>Homeland security adviser Frances Townsend said some of the information recovered was collected in 2000/2001.</p>

<p>But she added: "It appears that some of it may have been updated as recently as January of this year."</p></blockquote>

It's too the point that a few speakers are audibly hoarse by the end of their speeches.</p>

<p>My guess, cynical as it may be, is that Kerry had some polling information from early on in the primaries that showed his soft spoken style was conveying to the general view that he didn't really care that this was a more academic venture to him instead of something of concern.  He's taken that data and, like so many politicians before him, taken the approach if a little's good for you then a lot'll be that much better.</p>

        <title>Shady telemarketers</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/28/shady_telemarketers/"/>
        <updated>2004-07-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/28/shady_telemarketers</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Never do business with a company called Publishers Service International (PSI).  Don't bother trying to Google the name, according to Google they don't exist.  They "signed" me up for magazine subscriptions when I specifically asked about the ability to review it and cancel if I didn't like what I saw, they said I could, then later hid the but in the conversation.  I could cancel, "but" owed 'em six hundred and some odd dollars.  Umm... right.</p>

<p>That part came as news to me some two weeks later after checking over the list of magazines they had to subscribe to I realized there was absolutely nothing I wanted, much less six different subscriptions.  When I told them there was no way I was going to pay $600 having not received anything from them, the guy on the other end nicely enough said he would try to work something out and call me back.  About 4 hours later, he did call, and said he'd work out a special deal for me since I hadn't received anything, I would only have to pay $75.  So in four hours it gets cut by more than 1/6th?  Again... right.</p>

<p>Now the story gets interesting, I just received a call (Unknown caller, obviously), it's a collection agency in Florida saying that he's just "received an account from a company called PSI, does that ring a bell?"  I answered him say yes, that I cancelled the service, and had already taken care of it with them so there was no need for him to waste his time.  He went straight on to defensive mode and started in on the "Yes, sure... it is cancelled.  I show it cancelled as of July 6th."  When I tried to interject that it was cancelled earlier in either late April or early May by phone, he got even more hostile.  The end of the conversation went something like "Look... it <strong>is</strong> cancelled and I'm just calling to let you know you're going to be getting a letter. &lt;click&gt;"</p>

<p>The moral of this story.  Your response to every advance from a telemarketer should be "I can save us a lot of time, I don't handle business over the phone."</p>

        <title>The truth about Amendment 2</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/27/the_truth_about_amendment_2/"/>
        <updated>2004-07-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/27/the_truth_about_amendment_2</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've heard some wild things of late about the proposed <a href="http://www.senate.state.mo.us/04INFO/bills/SJ029.htm">Amendment 2</a> that will be up for approval on next week's ballot.  Some are saying that failing to pass it will legalize same-sex marriage.  This is outrightly <strong>false</strong>.  Same-sex marriage is not condoned, performed, or acknowledged in the state of Missouri per <a href="http://www.moga.state.mo.us/statutes/C400-499/4510000022.HTM">Missouri Revised Statutes, Title XXX, Chapter 451, Section 451.022</a>.  In case you don't want to visit the page, here's what the current Missouri law states:</p>

<ol><li>It is the public policy of this state to recognize marriage only between a man and a woman.</li>
<li>Any purported marriage not between a man and a woman is invalid.</li>
<li>No recorder shall issue a marriage license, except to a man and a woman.</li>
<li>A marriage between persons of the same sex will not be recognized for any purpose in this state even when valid where contracted.</li></ol>

<p>Couple this with the federal <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9609/10/gay.marriage/">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, and Missouri is in no threat of being overrun by married gays.  Well, at least until those "rogue judges" recognize this discrimination for what it is...</p>

<p>On a side note, the <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/04info/billtext/tat/sj029.htm">original date</a> for this amendment was the November general election.  It's odd that they would want to hold this dire matter over an additional 3 months to November instead of getting it on the first ballot available.  Of course, I'm sure that had nothing to do with trying to insure the religious right came out in droves to vote in November.  No, politicians would never try to manipulate a vote in a swing state. ;) </p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/27/the_purpose_of_this_blog_and_censorship</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was interesting.  It's nice to have a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5">lively debate</a>.  Something was said to me yesterday about deleting comments that were made and I just want to let everyone know that I won't be censoring any portion of this site.  Well, spammers and just general troublemakers are excluded from my non-censorship policy.</p>

<p>I think it's worth while to explain to everyone why I have this blog.  It is to chronicle for historical purposes my insights and reactions to everyday life.  It may be something as simple as <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/12/complete_devotion_to_something_that_s_ab">watching a game of hula-hoop toss</a>, or as controversial as <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5">same-sex marriage</a> (see also "<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/11/oh_how_the_times_change">Oh how the times changes</a>" and "<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/17/gay_marriage">Ironic coincidence, or a deliberate reminder</a>").  The idea is that at some point in the future I, and others, will be able to look back on these postings and the discussion that has sprung out of them and glean a clear understanding of me.</p>

<p>Given the purpose of this site to convey the message of me, when someone comments in opposition to a view I hold, I will engage them.  In an ideal world, through the comments we would have the opportunity to both further the defense of our ideas, counter the views of our "opponent", and both leave mutually respecting the other for putting forth a valid argument for their case... no matter how much we disagree with it.  Lofty goal, no?</p>

<p>So please, comment, leave you thoughts; but be prepared to defend them.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/24/title_5</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This article first appeared on <a href="http://www.kcbloggers.com/index.php?p=189">KCBlogger.com</a> in support of <a href="http://www.kcbloggers.com/index.php?p=165">the blog-a-thon</a></em></p>

<p>I just finished reading an article in the Pitch entitled <a href="http://www.pitch.com/issues/2004-07-22/feature.html">Ministers hate fags too</a>.  A very interesting read, but I'm curious how the bloggers in KC feel about this issue?  I haven't seen much blogging on it as of late.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, a <a href="http://blogkc.com/archives/2004/07/gay-marriage-poll/">recent poll</a> is showing that 62% of Missourians are in support of the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.  I'm just not sure how we can be going through this again.  Didn't we just have a civil rights movement where one group was being subjected to the whim of another?  I thought the outcome was that might (or poll numbers) doesn't equal right in America.  Did I miss something there?</p>

<p>What's really disheartening is to see the majority of the proponents of these anti-gay laws are ministers of the Christian faith.  Christianity according to the gospels is about love.  Condemnation was distinctly Old Testament or Paul.  It's kind of funny, in a sad sort of way.  One of the web sites that is spreading the Gospel - or at least their take on it - actually quotes Psalm 5:5.  In case you're not up on your Biblical knowledge, here's what my Interlinear (Hebrew/Greek/English) Bible says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[The boasters shall not set themselves before Your eyes;] You hate all workers of iniquity.</p></blockquote>

<p>They left out the part in brackets.  It's actually a condemnation of them as they "boast" that they have the truth.  That irony is beside the point, though.  "... workers of iniquity" is supposed to mean gays somehow.  Wouldn't it seem to reason that workers of iniquity could also mean workers of injustice?  Seems they've condemned themselves again.</p>

<p>You know, it's really sad when the fringes of any religion, be they Christianity, Muslim, or Jewish start cherry picking verses to match their beliefs.  The Klu Klux Klan thought they had God's approval.  The Al Qaeda operatives who flew planes into buildings thought they knew Allah's true wishes.  And now the religious right thinks they're doing "God's work" by trying to block truly equal protection under the law.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/22/opposition_to_sprint_arena_funded_from_s</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As everyone in Kansas City probably knows, there's a vocal opposition to the downtown arena.  The charge is being lead by the rental car industry with their claims that the increased taxes on rental cars will hurt their business and tourism to the city.  That's one thing I always consider when I'm planning a trip out of town - if the town has high taxes on their rental cars, I just won't go.  Why should I support their town?  I mean, all I'm doing is visiting their town and using their roads so why should I pay an extra tax?  But I digress...</p>

<p>I know the reasoning behind the opposition is that they're afraid the increase in their costs will cut into their profits either by reducing their profit margin or reducing their total rentals due to the increase in their expense.  What caught me off guard is that the majority of the funding for the opposition is coming from St. Louis.  It could be a complete coincidence, but isn't it odd that one of the main points of this arena is to compete for national events?  The same national events that St. Louis currently competes for.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Phone calls to old friends are always great.  They revive the bonds of friendship and give both of you a good feeling.  Emails can do the same thing... but a phone call is hard to beat.  As any of the followers of this blog know, I've been watching the Tour daily and even <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/tdf2002/">blogging</a> about it.  My appreciation for professional cycling comes from Darrell, a friend of mine who owns the best bike shop in El Paso (no really, it is the best in my opinion) called Franklin Mountain Cyclery.  After watching Lance walk all over the mountains the last few days and the constant reminder of Darrell as I watched the Tour daily, I decided to give him a buzz.</p>

<p>It was great, but after the basic "Are you riding much? Are you working?  What ya doing?" he asked if I wanted to hear some bad news.  He's been diagnosed with cancer.  It's not terminal, but he's undergoing chemo and hasn't been able to ride much because of it.  To quote him, "Shit happens to everyone... I just seem to get more than everyone else."  </p>

<p>Darrell's a great guy.  Just like anyone else he's got his quirks, but he's an honestly decent human being.  That's hard to find these days.  If you know Darrell, stop by or give him a buzz and let him know you're thinking of him.</p>

        <updated>2004-07-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/14/pedestrians_and_your_vision_of_downtown</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard <a href="http://www.kcmo.org/mayor.nsf/web/home?opendocument">Mayor Barnes</a> of <a href="http://www.kcmo.org">Kansas City</a> on the <a href="http://www.kcur.org/programDetail.asp?ID=2">Walt Bodine Show</a> this morning as I drove in to work.  She is, of course, stumping for the new <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/12/p57">Downtown Sprint Arena</a> - which I happened to be the first blogger in Kansas City to blog.  I am in favor of it, and will vote for it, but she caught me off guard with her approach to the downtown/urban core of Kansas City.  </p>

<p>She wants a city where people walk from the Rivermarket to Crown Center, or from Crown Center down to the Plaza, or any combination of those.  I don't know about you, but I personally don't think the city's current transportation infrastructure would support any kind of noticeable pedestrian traffic.  Short of a few buildings that are connected by sky-ways and the walkway that connects all of Crown Center, there is no real pedestrian-specific routes through the core of Kansas City.  Could you imagine trying to ride a bike down Main, Broadway, or Southwest Trafficway?</p>

<p>So, in an effort to find out where the Mayor stands on this and what she has planned, I emailed her the letter below.  I'd like your response as well.  What do you think needs to be done for Kansas City to be more pedestrian - or non-motorized vehicle rather - friendly?  Or do you think it even matters?  Of course, I have my thoughts, but I'll keep those to myself until I get some feedback.</p>

<fieldset><p><legend>Email to Mayor Barnes</legend>Good Afternoon Ms. Mayor;</p>

<p>While on my way to work this morning I listened to you on the Walt Bodine Show and am very excited to hear your vision of a downtown/urban area where walking and other alternative modes of transportation are not only encouraged but considered part of the norm.</p>

<p>As a cyclist, though, I'm not sure how practical this will be with Kansas City's current transportation infrastructure.  I feel that much of this part of Kansas City is not biker friendly and is geared almost completely toward motorized vehicles.  What are your current plans to help insure that the core of Kansas City, all the way from the Rivermarket to the Plaza are more accessible not only to walkers, but cyclists, Segway riders, and other modes of non-vehicular transport that have yet to be thought up?</p>

<p>I am posting this email on my personal weblog, TravisSwicegood.com, to encourage other Kansas City residents to consider this issue as well.  I do have a comment system on my website that is opened to the public and would encourage you to use that for your response so your thoughts can be shared with other's in the Kansas City area.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.</p></fieldset>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sat in front of <a href="http://www.sheridansfrozencustard.com/">Sheridan's Frozen Custard</a> one night this last week totally enthralled in the game that was taking place in front of me.  Two boys 10'ish in age were swapping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_hoop">hula hoops</a> back and forth in mid-air.  Their concentration rivaled that of a professional athlete.  Both still actually wore baseball uniforms from the night's previous activities.  This latest game which marshaled their attention didn't have any rules, didn't have any scores, and didn't seem to have an end in sight.  And I couldn't quit watching.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They were able to completely disregard their surroundings and focus 100% of their energy on something that had no consequence on anything.  Adults can't do this.  In our world where multi-tasking is king, we forget how to throw ourselves into a task that has no meaning.  Driving becomes a chore that has to be endured to get somewhere and is often tuned-out as we tune-in to a radio station and lose ourselves to the commentary or song that comes through our speakers.  Standing in line at the grocery store moves from being a welcome rest to an annoyance that might result in a talk with the manager if the checker actually services that person with 22 items in the "express" lane.  Learning, self-improvement, and spirituality all move from being a central part of your life that is constantly being molded and reshaped to a static part that is left as-is unless something shakes up your world view.</p>

<p>In the "adult world" things have to be completely quantified.  You don't pick up a book to experience the joy of reading; you do it because you need to brush up on this or that technique for next week's sales pitch.  You don't enjoy the extra few minutes you have to do absolutely nothing while you wait to check out; you impatiently check your watch thinking of all of the other <em>important</em> things you could be doing.  And you don't even consider tossing a hula-hoop for the sake of tossing a hula-hoop, there's too many <em>real</em> things that need to be done.</p>

<p>To quote <a href="http://citydharma.typepad.com/">Arthur Jeon</a>, we need to approach life a bit more childlike.  Not childish, but like a child.  Completely and totally immerse yourself in what you are doing.  If it's waiting in line, immerse yourself in the relaxation of having nothing to do.  If it's driving, focus on the act of moving through your surroundings.  And if it happens to be sitting on a grassy lawn with a hula-hoop near by, see how many times you can catch it...</p>

It's actually rather ironic in the role reverse that has happened with the Republican and Democratic parties.  It used to be that the Republicans were on the side of local governments and the Democrats wanted the federal government to solve the problems.  On the campaign trail this week, the President has been advocating a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriages, while Senator Kerry (my Democratic rival) is avoiding the issue by saying that the decision should be left up to the states.</p>

<p>I guess according to the White House, the federal government should stay out of the lives of everyday Americans unless what those everyday Americans are doing "violates" one of the principles of the commander-in-chief's religious views.</p>

<p>On a different note, is it just me or are the Bush-Cheney signs (seen in the background of the above image) a blatant attempt to harken back to the bygone days of yesteryear and the birth of the Interstate highway system?</p>

<p><em>Added</em><br />
Since "every culture [has] understood that traditional marriage is crucial to the well-being of families", why doesn't the President go ahead and ban quick Vegas weddings like <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/news/news1.shtml">this one</a>.  Oh yeah, that's right.  Marriage between two heterosexuals adds to the stability of our culture, no matter how many hours it lasts.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/11/bikers_suck</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yup... we suck!  Or at least that's what pubescent kid would have had me to believe as he passed me on Waukomis a few nights ago, defiantly shaking his skateboard out the window of the car he road shotgun in, undoubtedly too young to have his own driver's license.  It got me to thinking, since skate boarding is so apparently superior to cycling why don't I just switch sports.  I wouldn't want to get caught on the loosing end of this cultural revolution.  I started thinking about all of the things I could do on a skateboard that would never happen on a two wheeled bike.  </p>

<p>Hopping on the vert ramp and landing some killer stunts... wait, I can do that on a bike.  Well, there's the street course.  Hmm... I can do that on a bike too.  Then there's dirt jumping - oh right, that's only on a bike.  Then there's downhilling.  Opps, there I go again getting bikes and skateboards mixed up again.  And of course, I've always wanted to hop on a skateboard and make my way around town to destinations dozens of miles away.  Hmm...  Maybe I should ride my bike and put the board in a nap sack so I can get there faster.</p>

<p>Well at least there's the superstar status and unbelievable athletic ability I can build up as a pro skater.  But my superstar status would make me the teenage male's counterpart to Britney and my athletic ability would decrease with every broken bone.  There's always the full-state and multi-country grand tours to attend all over the world in addition to a Spring full of classic events, some of which count their years of running with 3 digits. Oh shoot, there I go mixing up cycling and skateboarding again.</p>

<p>You know, now that I think about it maybe we cyclists don't suck after all...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an interesting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/news/story/0,12976,1255752,00.html?=rss,">article</a> - it looks like smoking marijuana could increase the smoker's night-vision.  Look at all the money we're spending on the military for night-vision goggles that could be saved.  And then there's the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/enforcement/">Border Patrol</a> who are always complaining about not having enough technology to fight the immigrants (scourge that they are) and all this time they've just been confiscating and destroying the natural remedy to their night vision shortcomings.</p>

        <title>Hi, my name is Travis... and I'm a addicted to speed</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/06/hi_my_name_is_travis_and_i_m_a_addicted_/"/>
        <updated>2004-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/07/06/hi_my_name_is_travis_and_i_m_a_addicted_</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn't even realize it.  Looking back on it, my addiction was obvious.  Sure, it felt like it helped me get more things done, but in reality it was hurting me.  "You don't offer overnight shipping?  Well I'll just find someone else who does."  "What's this idiot doing going 10 under in the fast lane?"  Or better yet, the endless frustration at how the "Express Lanes" seem to take forever - and all you're doing is sitting there.  Wasting time.</p>

<p>No, I'm not addicted to the <em>speed</em> you're thinking about.  I'm addicted to everyday speed.  I want things done and done now.  From time to time, I tend to cram too much into my schedule, try to take on too many "projects", or almost without fail, try to read too many books.  For those who are counting, I'm up to 7 books concurrently now.  When I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/006054578X%3Fv%3Dglance">In Praise of Slowness</a>, it sounded like something right up my alley.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Actually, I've realized for about 6 months now that I have a tendency toward the fast lane addiction.  During this time, I've been making an active effort to reverse my ways.  Reading books such as <a href="">Time Management from the Inside-Out</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1400049083">City Dharma</a>, I'm trying to find the rhythm that works best for me.  I'm slowly getting there, but progress is being made.  </p>

<p>I don't really know what the trigger was - possibly there wasn't one.  For the author of the book, <a href="http://www.inpraiseofslow.com/">Carl Honore</a>, the epiphany came when he read a newspaper article while impatiently waiting in line at the airport.  The article talked about the sixty second bedtime story.  His first reaction was how wonderful this would be.  In ten minutes, he could get through a half-dozen or more stories, and having spent his <em>quality time</em> with his child be off to more productive tasks.  After the initial euphoria of this new discover wore off, he realized how ludicrous the idea actually was.  His need for speed was cheating him out of spending time with his child.</p>

<p>As an odd footnote, whenever I write about books I'm reading, I'm sure to include a link or two to Amazon via my "Amazon Associates" account.  I figure somewhere along the line I might actually be able to make a few cents off of one of these articles, so why not go ahead and put the link in there.  While looking up the page for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/006054578X/103-8221554-6166240?v=glance">In Praise of Slowness</a>, I noticed the <em>Better Together</em> section for this book contains a packaged purchase with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1400049083">City Dharma</a>.  Both of these books were purchased on separate visits to the local Barnes &amp; Noble, both from different sections of the bookstore, each just out of a sheer chance.  Odd footnote indeed.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm working on a book by Roger Housden called Sacred America.  I actually started it nearly a year ago in El Paso, but it has been packed up until this past weekend.  After "rediscovering" it and realizing I still had my place marked, I decided to give it a read this evening.</p>

<p>It is an amazing book, offering insights to the various spiritual paths that have manifested themselves inside the US.  The chapter I read this evening dealt with two Georgian spiritual movements, that found in Americus and the Habitat for Humanity headquarters and the Auburn district of Atlanta and Ebenezer Chapel with a brief touch of a suburban Unity Church.  All three different, yet all three the same.  From my recollection of the book Housden has done a great job tying the seemingly "different" spiritual practices together in their commonality.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0684848384%3Fv%3Dglance">this book</a> to anyone who would like to read a book about the uplifting side of America.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I thought TV had reached an all-time low, and nearly swore it off completely.  A few good shows, which seemingly all ended this year, kept me coming back though.  But no, <em>Fear Factor</em> with it's sophomoric stunts was mild.  No, it was just child's play.  Now baby boomers in corporate America show that they do have absolutely no dignity and will stop at nothing for ratings.  Announcing Fox's <em>Trading Spouses</em>!</p>

<p>The idea isn't as my title would make it seem, there's supposedly nothing sexual in the show.  But I wouldn't put it past one of these rating hungry exec's to suggest that it might make things a bit more interesting if the "feelings normally found in a marriage started to develop - all for artistic reality, you know...".  Anyhow, the idea is that two dads or moms switch households and try to make a go of their normal lives, living as "Dad" or "Mom" in their new houses.  Sorry, but this is ridiculous.  What makes it worse is that they wouldn't give the go ahead to something like this if they didn't have focus groups saying it would get ratings!</p>

<p>In a more general vein, why are the networks so afraid of trying something new?  CBS had a hit in CSI - so what did they do?  Commission the writers/creators to come up with their next big idea?  Nope, they doubled the number of writers and created <em>CSI: Miami</em>.  And this next year they're going to add a few more writers and do <em>CSI: New York</em>.  Talk about scared stupid.  The networks are so afraid of loosing a half a point here, or a half a point there that they simply refuse to embrace creative change.  Nope, repackage and rehash are the words of the day for TV.  But they do seem to have a new mantra for reality TV: Double digit IQ's?  Who needs 'em?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who don't know me that well, <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com">Vote Twice for Swice</a> isn't a legitimate attempt to win the Presidency.  Instead, it's an experiment in <em>political wikis</em>.  There are two protected pages that only I can edit, everything else is up for grabs.  Being a wiki, it is entirely possible that various portions will be changed by myself or others, but the idea is to create a <em>Centrist Presidential Platform</em> and bring awareness to one of the potential flaws of electronic voting that can be addressed if the politicians make it happen - the write-in vote.</p>

<p>I see the possibility for the quick and hasty embrace of electronic voting machines post Election 2000 in the name of making sure "every vote counts".  What happens when the write-in vote isn't an option any longer because touch screens without that option have replaced them?  What happens when someone like myself, outside the political - well, possibly even the regular - mainstream decide to launch a grassroots attempt for any seat?  If I can't get my name on the ballot because of time restraints or the lack of financing to mobilize a state-wide/nation-wide signature campaign I am effectively blocked from entering the race.  Thus the two parties, in their quick embrace of technology to fix a problem have fixed the method for getting into an election.</p>

<p>Electronic voting is the answer - we need a fast, accurate voting machine that can provide immediate feedback to the voter to insure that their vote is cast for the candidate that they wanted it cast for.  Write-in votes can still be a part of this equation.  The last few years have seen character recognition software (<abbr title="Character Recognition Software">CRS</abbr>) become extremely powerful.  Voters could be presented with the ballot, with one extra place to select for write-in votes.  Once there, they are given a box in which to print the name of the person they wish to vote for.  The written name is run through a CRS program and displayed back to the user for them to verify.  At this time, they can make any adjustments necessary by selecting a character and using the on-screen keyboard.  Thus preserves the "write-in" vote, and still provides a means of privately checking to make sure it is recorded correctly.</p>

<p>So is a <em>Vote (once or twice) for Swice</em> a wasted vote?  Both parties are so essentially the same that a vote for a change might be your best bet.  Visit <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com">Vote Twice for Swice</a> and help create the platform that if elected I will uphold.  Once that's in place, then decide if it's a waste to flip a coin to decide who you vote for, or to vote for something and someone that stands for something different.</p>

I have them sort of ready, but I'm using gThumb to generate a gallery of all of the images I have.  The only problem is I don't have the skin in place to make it look half-way descent, so...

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aren't there more important things to be doing in Washington?  Last time I checked, we still had a "war" on our hands in Iraq, Bin Laden was still on the loose, and we house some of the worst educated children of a developed nation in the world.  Seems like more energy should be spent focusing on how to fix those issues instead of determining whether decorum exists in the Senate and making calls to "rise above partisan retaliation".  How about finding that "common ground" and quit talking about it.  There's work to be done by both sides.  The fact that so much time is wasted on whether the VP is sorry for his "forceful" words just shows how little politicians actually want to accomplish.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/23/why_should_i_vote_for_ralph_nader</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don't know that I should, but a guy who's so involved in community activism that when he tries to draw a comparison between being active as the underdog and loosing a basketball game, only to say "when you're 30 points down in the 4th quarter, do you give up and go home" should deserve a second look.  Seriously, in a commentary/news piece done on <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1972353">NPR this evening</a>, Ralph was quoted saying the above to a group of students.  Pretty funny, I think.</p>

<p>While Nader is generally too liberal for my centrist tastes, he does traits I find interesting.  He "detests" reality TV which in and of itself is almost a reason to vote for him.  The one thing I find troubling, his lack of an embrace for technology.  He still favors a manual typewriter instead of a word processor.  His reason is quite unique though...  He says it forces you to get it right the first time.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/23/my_current_reading_list</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who know me know that I suffer from RADD - Reading Attention Deficeit Disorder.  I wonder from one book to the next, with a shelf full of partially read books or, as is the case right now a shelf full of books which each get read an hour or so once a week.  The present time is no different.  I am working on no fewer than 5 books; 6 if you count the book of poetry that I am making my way through.  So, as I know each of you my loyal readers are dying to know exactly what I am reading, I thought I'd provide a list.  They are listed in order from the time they were started</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0760745293/qid%3D1088049407/sr%3Dka-1/fromthecrossr-20">The New Humanists: Science at the Edge</a> edited by John Brockman.  This is a compilation of essays written by biologists, computer scientists, anthropologists... basically, anyone who has a "ist" after their title might show up in this book.  Each essay is really insightful and deals with many of the issues of the day.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200068/qid%3D1088049375/sr%3Dka-1/fromthecrossr-20">Free Culture: How big media uses technology and the law to lock down culture and control creativity</a> by Lawrence Lessig.  How's that for a long sub-title.  It's an excellent book that I've blogged (<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/16/p76">post #1</a>, <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/22/first_impression_to_harsh">post #2</a>) about before.  The biggest problem I have with it is that <a href="http://www.lessig.org">Lessig</a> is a lawyer and as such tends to be long winded for my tastes.  Everything he adds does add to the story and message he is conveying, but it does take some time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060920432/qid%3D1088049328/sr%3Dka-1/fromthecrossr-20">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (don't ask me how to pronounce it).  As you might gather from the name, this is a book about achieving what many call "flow" in your life.  This is more a scholarly text than a how-to "get happy" book and as such has some rather dense reading.  For the scientific approach the book has taken, it does manage to keep my attention rather well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0802713378/qid%3D1088049211/sr%3D1-1">Samurai Chess: Mastering Strategic Thinking Through the Martial Art of the Mind</a> by Michael J. Gelb &amp; Raymond Keene.  I saw this book in the <em>Bargain Books</em> section of the new <a href="http://www.bn.com/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> at <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/21/zona_rosa_opens_in_kansas_city_northland">Zona Rosa</a> and had to get it.  Not because it was a great deal, but because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks%26field-author%3DGelb%252C%2520Michael%2520J.">Michael Gelb</a> is co-author of it.  I believe he is an excellent writer based on a previous book of his that I read, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0440508274/qid%3D1088050004/sr%3D8-1">How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci</a>.  Couple this prior experience with his writing style, and the fact that I'm always up for learning a little more about chess and mental improvement, and I just had to buy it.  Really!  There was no choice. ;)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1400049083/qid%3D1088049173/sr%3D8-1">City Dharma: Keeping your Cool in the Chaos</a> by Arthur Jeon.  Perusing through the Spirituality section at the aforementioned <a href="http://www.bn.com/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, this book's loud "City Dharma" yield sign caught my attention.  A quick read through the Introduction, and the fact that it was the only one of the shelf made it a must buy.  I've just delved into the first of it this evening, and it looks very promising.</li></ul>

        <title>Time Management from the Inside Out</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/21/time_management_from_the_inside_out/"/>
        <updated>2004-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/21/time_management_from_the_inside_out</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I pride myself on ability.  I'm good at most of what I do.  Not because I only do what I am good at, but because I get good at what I do.  One area has always escaped me, though - time management.  No, chronic lateness is not my malaise and I don't generally lack motivation to get going on things - well, except cleaning house.  My problem revolves around staying on track.  I have a tendency to be schizophrenic when it comes to my work; my lack of concentration can lead to some interesting developments through the day.  </p>

<p>This generally serves me well, as my constantly changing view point allows me to see nearly every possible aspect of program and create a plan of attack to meet each challenge my clients will or may face with the software I develop for them.  A project I am still working on has recently hit the point that it needs to start developing into a usable piece of code instead of a continually evolving framework.  As this time came about, I read a magazine article in <a href="http://www.bicycling.com">Bicycling</a> about finding more time to ride.  The tips were provided by a supposed expert in time management, <a href="http://www.juliemorgenstern.com">Julie Morgenstern</a> and referenced her book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805064699/qid%3D1087786236/sr%3Dka-1/fromthecrossr-20/002-4417587-4145645">Time Management from the Inside Out</a>.  Finding more bike time is always good and the need to really buckle down and get this project in a workable state made head over to <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> to get this book.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Of course, being the mega-carry-all-books under the sun kind of store that B&amp;N is, I was able to find a copy.  (And you thought I wasn't going to get it, right?)  I read through the introduction which must speak to me in order for me to invest the time necessary to read the whole book.  The intro was well written, to the point, and easy to read.  So me and the book made our way home.  The book was an easy read - it took just over a week of an hour or so of reading each night.  The whole book had a common-sensical tone and most of it fell under the "why didn't I think of that" or "why don't I do it that way already?" headers.</p>

<p>One of the tools she suggests you employ is a Time Map - the overall picture of what you want to do with your time.  This isn't the planner, it is the guide that your planner should be based on.  Think of it as your personal time mission statement.  This is a very individual thing, and she suggests that it stay as simple and open, or as detailed as you want.  One consistent theme throughout the book is that you should build your schedule around how you work and play - <em>your</em> goals.  Though she offers some very specific tips, each of them come in the form of instruction any good teacher would use.  They each are general guidelines that you are to follow to come to your own outcome.  There are no "7:15 - Get out of bed, 7:20 - Brush teeth &amp; other personal hygiene, 7:30 - ...".  This book's advice is all very open-ended.</p>

<p>Morgenstern's time management skills came from her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0805056491/qid%3D1087788283/sr%3D8-1">organizing background</a>.  This "perfect" one thing and apply it to everything mentality makes this book a double bonus.  The constant cross-referencing makes it easy to see how her time management and organizational skills could easily apply to other areas of your life.  One obvious cross-over is the ability to manage a team based on these same principles.  The chapter Purge offered some great advice for delegation, a task I sometimes find myself having to work harder than I should on.</p>

<p>I found this book to be well written and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to hone their time management skills.  It should be required reading to anyone who is even considering team management of any sort.  For me, it was best to read the book cover-to-cover and now I plan on going back through it to do the exercises.  Knowing the reasons behind what I am doing and how the results will be applied, I believe my exercises will be much more productive.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/19/trip_to_the_zoo</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got back from the <a href="http://www.kansascityzoo.org/">Zoo</a>.  My sister and her husband are in town for a few weeks, so we decided to spend this afternoon checking out the caged wildlife.  The <a href="http://www.kansascityzoo.org/">Kansas City Zoo</a> is really a great zoo that takes more than the 4 hours we gave it to go through the entire zoo.  Our trip through Australia involved riding the <a href="http://www.kansascityzoo.org/Visit/Index.asp?IdS=001197-E21BA00&amp;Reference=Transportation&amp;~=">train</a> through it.  I've got a lot of pictures - filled up the memory stick I took with me.  If I get a few spare minutes, I'll post a few pictures on <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">Me and Travis</a>.</p>

<p>Going through the Africa exhibit, I couldn't help feeling sorry for the animals.  The leopard was in a cage of more than "enough" size, but it just didn't seem right having it caged at all.  The same with the gorillas, a crowd favorite.  Their faces look unbelievably human anyhow, and they had such long expressions on them.  They were just sitting, watching people.  My sister went to take a picture of one and after looking straight at her it covered its face and looked away.  It's almost as if he was saying, "Please... don't take advantage of me."  It's not as bad of a life as being a circus animal.  At least you are given some hope of a "wild" existence.  But still, it would be much more impressive if the cages were the pathways that the humans walked through and all of the animals were free roaming inside the park.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like the last few weeks have been a series of calamities.  I've been fighting downed Internet connections, computer problems, server issues, and all last week I've had a heck of a sinus/allergy/cold-type thing.  This morning, I woke up feeling the best I have in a week, only to come in to work only to find that the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr>, and thus my Internet was completely down.  We didn't get it working until about an hour ago, and that's about the time my body says it's time for lunch.  So after a quick sweat session at the Gate's on Main St (they apparently think an AC would hamper the "atmosphere"), I'm back.  I'm behind... but I'm back.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lightning used to amaze me.  I used to sit in awe of the abrupt, raw power that it generates.  It still makes me take notice, but it doesn't amaze me anymore.  What amazes me is a cyclist.  How they can go for hours on end, and push themselves to their body's end, and still find that extra 50 watts of power for the final sprint they didn't know they had.  How they can ride a tempo pace up a hill and go 'til their legs are about to explode, only to find one final burst of energy and ten more feet to keep everyone else behind them as they crest the hill first.</p>

<p>No... Lightning does what it does as it's supposed.  The cyclist, they do what they're not supposed to out of sheer will.  And until I can ride no more, I hope to always be able to call myself... <strong>a cyclist</strong>.</p>

        <title>Light pollution in the Kansas City northland</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/13/light_pollution_in_the_kansas_city_north/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/13/light_pollution_in_the_kansas_city_north</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like living in the northland.  Kansas City south of the river is great, and I really love the urban part of the city, but there's just a more relaxed atmosphere once you cross the Missouri river.</p>

<p>Part of that relaxed atmosphere comes from the as yet underdeveloped "countryside" that is right in the middle of Kansas City, Missouri.  From just about anywhere, you are only a few minutes from being in what looks like farmland and from that farmland, you're only a few minutes back to the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>

<p>Last night about 10 PM, power went out along the Platte and Clay county lines.  It was rather eerie to look down the street and see no street lights or porch lights on.  Likewise, a look across the creek to the other side of the hill had a similarly lifeless look.  Without the lights dotting the hillside, it really does feel you're in the country.  Unless you catch the clouds move overhead.</p>

<p>Each cloud was illuminated by the orange glow of the northland's light pollution.    It was easy to tell that power wasn't out all the way around us because of this glow.  North Oak Trafficway still had power, and it appeared that the car dealerships and Metro North Mall still had power as you could see the white glow coming from their direction.</p>

<p>I think one of the big things that the Kansas City Northland has going for it is that you can feel like you're getting away from it.  A few <a href="http://www.darksky.org/infoshts/is090.html">simple steps</a> to insure the integrity of our nightsky could help insure that the northland keeps its rural appeal while offering all the amenities of Kansas City.</p>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/11/why_is_reagan_s_death_so_important_to_am</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Americans are a bunch of self-absorbed, lazy, do nothings who don't care about anyone but themselves... and not even themselves collectively.  No.  They're concerned about numero uno and that's it.  Or that's the perception in a lot of the world.  Right or wrong, the last two and a half generations of Americans have been all about the "me".  Why then, with this unending obsession with ourselves are we as a nation so engrossed with the death of a President that has been out of office for more than 15 years and out of the public eye, privately battling Alzheimer's for the last 10 years?</p>

<p>Simple.  9/11 provided the same thing that citizens of this nation so desperately want.  The feeling of being a part of something that is larger than themselves.  The 90's and the first few years of 21st century have seen an unprecedented rise in volunteerism.  9/11 saw an unprecedented outpouring of sympathy and support.  And now Reagan's death has prompted over 100,000 Americans to journey to Washington DC or California to pay their respects.  It isn't out of duty, or obligation that they do this.  They are just dying to be a part of something they feel is larger than them.</p>

<p>As a nation, we should be ashamed that we are so unable to find meaning in our everyday existence that an outpouring of emotion of this magnitude at one time seems such a foreign event.</p>

        <title>Matchstick Men</title>

        <updated>2004-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/10/matchstick_men</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm not a big movie person.  Being the techno-mystic that I am, I really enjoyed the Matrix Trilogy.  I've always liked the types of movies that draw on our collectively rich spiritual history.  The original Star Wars trilogy did the same thing.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00012QLB4/qid%3D1086926423/sr%3D1-1">Matchstick Men</a> doesn't fit that mold.  It's a "comedic thriller", as the back cover says.  It should also say:</p>

<p>"One damn fine movie..." - The Man, The Myth, The Legend... Travis Swicegood</p>

<p>Ok, so maybe I'll get my name on the back of the 2nd release.  This ranks up there with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00005V9HH/qid%3D1086926677/sr%3D1-1">Usual Suspects</a> as one of the best movies I've seen.  This movie is a bit slower than I would have liked, so I can't say it's the best.  But if you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and like the type of movies that Spacey generally plays in, I think you'll find this one quite worth 2 hours of your time.</p>

<p>On a side note, I really thought I had seen somewhere that Cage was among Hollywood's left-handed population.  I know we share the same birthday.  I thought we had the same handedness as well, but throughout this movie he is right-handed: he bowls right-handed, he writes right-handed.  Hmm...</p>

        <title>How Bush could lose the Presidency</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/10/how_bush_could_lose_the_presidency/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/10/how_bush_could_lose_the_presidency</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Bush should win this election.  An incumbent is hard to beat, especially when that incumbent is heading up a war that the majority of his constituents feel is just.  But Bush could easily loose this election through apathy.</p>

<p>Recently, a <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/terror/20040609-1350-prisonerabuse.html">memo</a> was leaked that gave the definition of "torture" according to the Justice Department.  In the memo it appears that the level of "torture" is only reached when someone's death will be caused by the treatment they are being subjected to.</p>

<p>Couple this with the recent appearance of arguing both sides of the fence in regards to the Guantanamo Bay detainees.  In the US the President's council argued that the prisoners where not on US soil, so they should not receive the same protection guaranteed by the Constitution to those in the US regardless of citizenship.  On the other hand, they argued that the detainees were not protected under the international laws of war because they were being held on US property.  Which is it?  Well, I guess since they are just on US property and not on US sovereign land they're just at the President's pleasure.</p>

<p>And recently, the President's legal team argued before the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> that the President has unchecked powers of detainment when the US is at war.  Well, not fully unchecked, as long as it has to do with "war".  Could you imagine if McCarthy had been President and had this power?</p>

<p>So with the President setting himself up as such an unlikable chap, how are people supposed to feel like they should go vote?  The short story - they don't, and might not.  I think the President's camp realizes this now.  As I wrote this article, I saw the first "positive" ad campaign that focused up the sunny side.  I think they're realizing that with all of the bad PR they're getting, they need to focus on the happy, feel good message.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was flipping through the channels on the television when I noticed a WNBA game wasn't a game, but a news cast.  I stopped to see what had happened, to find out that President Reagan had passed away this afternoon.  Just an hour earlier, I had been in my car listening to NPR when they reported that Nancy Reagan had said this afternoon that he was entering the final days.  Apparently, "days" was being too optimistic.</p>

<p>He has publicly battled Alzheimer's disease for nearly a decade now, and has probably suffered from it for longer than that.  In recent years, he has been unable to recognize and remember close friends and family members and in the last few months could not even tell who Nancy was, his wife of more than 50 years.</p>

<p>Of all of the diseases that I could be afflicted with, I believe Alzheimer's or any similar mental disease would be the most painful.  I can not imagine loosing control of my thoughts, emotions, and actions.  Not having the ability to clearly and rationally approach a situation as simple as someone walking in the room is terrifying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alzheimersprevention.org/prevention_program.htm">Promising research</a> is indicating that Alzheimer's may be preventable though.  It appears that through diet and mental and physical exercise, you can keep your brain in top shape and fight the atrophy that causes diseases like Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>So keep those creative juices flowing, work that crossword, and go for that walk.  It may mean that you remember who I am in 25 years...</p>

        <title>So be it?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got an email this afternoon from a friend who sends out a bunch of forwards at least once a week.  Most of them are pretty funny, some are kind of crude, but a lot of 'em bring a smile to my face.  This one hit a note though:</p>

<fieldset><p><legend>Quote from email</legend>There is a recent poll that says, 9 out of 10 Americans believe "Under God" belongs<br />
in our Pledge of Allegiance. <br />
Should the 9 people be forced to suppress their beliefs for the 1 who don't believe? </p>

<p>Why don't we just tell the 1 person to Sit Down and SHUT UP!!! </p>

<p>If you agree, pass this on, if not simply delete.</p></fieldset>

<p>If pollsters would have asked Mississippians if blacks and whites should be in the same schools 50 years ago, I think 9 out of 10 respondents would have said that shouldn't happen.</p>

<p>If pollsters would have asked men if women should have voting rights 90 years ago, 9 out of 10 would have said no.</p>

<p>If pollsters would have asked southern's if slaves should be treated as property or human beings  150 years ago, 9 out of 10 would have said property.</p>

<p>You see, the facts pollster give you can be wrong.  The data they have collected is not in error, it is that the frame of mind of the folks they're polling which is.  I'm not saying we shouldn't include "under God" in the pledge, but let us remember that "under God" isn't a tradition from the founding of our nation or any other such momentous event, unless something happened in 1954 that I don't know about.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <em>If someone had wanted me dead, he missed a good chance when...</em></p>

<p>Fireworks were crackling all around.  They weren't the American kind that reverberate for miles around.  No these, were the cheap sparklers and bottle rockets that make just enough noise and put of just enough light to make them interesting.  No frills here, but it's a almost a 3rd world country.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>People have forgotten about the border towns.  The war on terror has tightened the lock on our borders.  "<em>Border Gaurds</em>" from Mississippi who can't tell a Mexican from an Iraqi are left to make split judgements and err on the side of "caution" more often than not.  This makes <em>us</em> feel safe, but it's left tens of thousands of impoverished souls lingering in these border towns.  Tonight, you wouldn't know it by the celebration that's going on in the park.</p>

<p>I had forgotten where I was... Until just a minute ago.  One too many Dos Equis and a wrong turn on the way back across the bridge have landed me in <em>wrong</em> neighborhood.  Half a block down the wrong street, and it all comes rushing back to you as you think you've been sobered up.</p>

<p>On a porch with an old, a weak light illuminates an elder man rocking quickly, his gaze fixed squarely on me.  A cat on the opposite side of the road caught my attention as it darted behind a car.  Ahead of me, there's a group of young men huddle around the corner.  Until just a minute ago, they were busy talking to themselves.  Then one of them spotted me.  Now they're quiet, intently watching my every move.</p>

<p>I don't want to seem to cautious, but "I'm in a foreign country..." pops into my mind.  None of these guys fit the thug appearance I would see in America.  I wouldn't even notice them just a half mile across the river, but "I'm in a foreign country..."</p>

<p>"I'm in a foreign country.  I'm in a foreign country!"  My thoughts keep coming back to that.  The vulnerability is overwhelming.  The Dos Equis and adrenaline are sending my brain into overdrive; the sweet alcohol and lime is clouding my thoughts.  Now I can't even remember which way I turned to get on this street.  A drunk white guy in a bad neighborhood in Mexico at 1 A.M.  If somebody wanted me dead, I could disappear right now and no one would be the wiser until tomorrow...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know... I know... Nothing really original in a few days, but I have a good reason.</p>

<p>The last few days have been hectic.  By the time I get through with work, all I want to do is unwind.  This creative writing bit is actually helping out.  It's nice to immerse your mind in something totally different for a little while.  Unfortunately, the last two days my mind was totally immersed in problems...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Two days ago, my Internet connection went down about 4:30 in the afternoon.  I finished up, discussed a few things, and headed home pretty sure I'd be able to get it up and running first thing in the morning the next day.  Yesterday (the next day) at 3 PM, I finally got my Internet connection back up.  With most of the day gone, I spent the rest of the afternoon getting everything in order: checking on the server, trying to make sure nothing earth shattering was in my Inbox, just the miscellaneous things that you keep tabs on throughout the day.</p>

<p>Today, started out much better.  Right as I got into my morning stretch to really get some major programming out of the way, my IMAP server went down.  One of the joys that goes with a dedicated server, if something goes wrong you get to call yourself.  Well, the tech support at me, myself, and I wasn't able to get it back up and running right away.  I actually left work this afternoon still not having it back up.  After I got home, a quick check of the few messages I had left on different forums finally yielded something, and I got my email back up about 6 PM this evening.</p>

<p>So... here's to tomorrow.  May Friday be productive so something gets done this week...</p>

        <title>Player freedom in cricket</title>

        <updated>2004-06-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/06/01/player_freedom_in_cricket</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today's topic: <em>Read an article about something in which you have little interest. See if the article might make you rethink your position on the subject. Write about whether it succeeded.</em></p>

<p>I think cricket is boring.  Honestly, it's probably because I've never watched a game in my life.  The few times I've seen it played on TV or in a movie, it just didn't seem like a game that would be very engaging.  So, to see if an article could sway me, I set out for Google looking for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=cricket%20news">cricket news</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I found <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/">cricinfo</a> which appears to be a pretty bustling site.  Lots of information going on with too many places to focus on, but stop Travis - this isn't a review of web site usability, it's about cricket.  Not knowing where to jump into the site, I selected the top story, <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2004/JUN/159182_AUS_02JUN2004.html">One small leap for player freedom</a>.  Turns out, cricket players in Australia have not have freedom of speech.  Their contracts specify that they can not say anything detrimental to the league, other teams, other players, or anything related to the sport.  A contractual "<em>If you can't say something nice, but say anything at all...</em>", just like your mom used to tell you.</p>

<p>The idea of a sports league imposing a gag order of sorts on its players seems rather odd to me.  America is home of the Neon Dion's of the world, the Kobe Bryant's who fly their private jets from the game to their court appearances and back.  Our "<em>superstar's</em>" value seem to go up with each arrest, each charge, and each new antic that they pull.  How antiquated is a contract saying you can't even speak your mind?</p>

<p>Or is that just the American coming out in me?  Maybe we need a bit more self-restraint.  Maybe the Bryant's of the world would think twice before gallivanting with who knows who night after night if he thought his millions might be in jeopardy.  Maybe cricketers do have something right.  Who knows, maybe this antiquated sport might just have something to offer us Westerners.  Maybe I'll check out a game the next time I see one on TV.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the original aims of my starting a blog last fall was to better my writing abilities.  <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a> transformed from a personal site into a business site, so I left my thoughts for more creative writing and adopted a more professional approach toward what I presented.

Hopefully, I've succeeded in some small part.</p>

This afternoon I received my monthly writer's prompts from <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/">Writer's Digest</a>, so I have a full 30 ideas for various pieces things to write about.  Now I'm not going to promise a full 30 different creative pieces, but I'm going to see how many I can come up with.  I should be able to handle 10... We'll see.</p>

        <title>The Orkut Effect</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/05/31/the_orkut_effect/"/>

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/05/31/the_orkut_effect</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
It is amazing what not being able to easily have something will do to people.  On <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a>, my business weblog, I've posted a few articles on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut.com</a>.  For those of you who don't know, Orkut is an invite only social-networking tool.  The idea is I have a circle of friends, and I can browse around and find friends of friends for business or personal networking.  Neat idea, but it's been done a dozen times - most notably by <a href="http://www.friendster.com/index.jsp">Friendster</a>.  What makes Orkut different is that it is invite only, thus we have the <em>Orkut Effect</em>.</p>

<p>
People will go searching the Internet looking for an invite, as witnessed by the number of searches I've received from people who have entered "<em>orkut invite</em>" or some similarly worded phrase.  Right now, I have 15 "<em>friends</em>" in Orkut, and only 2 of them I've ever met.  Of the remaining 13, only 3 more of them are people I actually know.  The other 10 are all people who've emailed me asking for an invite.  Some of them are actually using the system.  One guy already has a network of 20 friends built up.  Apparently all of his buddies were on Orkut, but no one would invite him. :)</p>

<p>
Anyhow, I think it's interesting how folks will email a perfect stranger and ask for an invite into an "invitation" only site.  Pretty interesting.  So, next time someone you don't know asks you to do something, you'll know it's just the <em>Orkut Effect</em> at work.</p>

It would be really cool if the building could look like an old time building with gargoyles, but instead of scary monkeys and monsters, the gargoyles would be the heads of cows and pigs and other farm animals to celebrate our livestock history, and when it rains, they would act as scuppers and water could shoot out of their mouths, and that would fit into our reputation as the City of Fountains.</fieldset>

<p>
The firm commissioned to come up with a plan to create the downtown arena has created a web site called <a href="http://www.yourkcarena.com/">YourKCAreana.com</a> to solicit suggestions from the community.  They are also posting at least some of the suggestions they are getting on their web site.  The suggestions range from cow headed gargoyles to "...it should be iconic, but not idiosyncratic..." - would an architecture expert please explain that one to me?</p>

<p>
One very small suggestion is on to something.  Jen, from KCMO suggested "<em>Industrial form with exposed beams etc, but a warm/home touch with large photos of KC in the hall.</em>"  I think this is great!  Create a large <em>warehouse</em> effect, with huge exposed beams and ductwork, great big sweatshop windows, the whole nine yards.  This would do wonders to tie into the loft / new urbanist communities that are being built around the downtown area.  And you could throw in a cow head scupper too! :)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
It is almost impossible to win both the Giro de Italia, and the Tour de France in the same year.  Winning one takes such a toll on your body, as Simoni demonstrated last year.  He dominated the early race in Italy only to finish in the 80's in France.  Could it be with this year's mediocre finish in the Giro, that he has decided that a Tour de France victory would be more important than a Giro win?  I wondered the same thing as the last stage of the Giro started today and within 15 minutes, Bob Roll asked the same question.</p>

<p>
I guess we'll find out come July...</p>

        <title>National WWII Memorial - were the baby boomers self-involved?</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/05/30/national_wwii_memorial_were_the_baby_boo/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Yesterday, the National WWII Memorial was dedicated.  Over 16,000,000 Americans were involved in the war effort, over 400,000 died.  Yet, until yesterday, there was no dedicated World War II memorial.  This wouldn't seem odd, if there were not WWI, Korean, and Vietnam memorials already in place.  The <a href="http://www.vvmf.org/index.cfm?SectionID=4">Vietnam Wall</a> has stood for nearly 20 years, yet barely more than 10% of the number of lives were effected.  In my opinion, the fact that the Wall has stood for so long, and the WWII Memorial is just now being done proves that what was called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0375502025/qid%3D1085930681/sr%3D8-1">America's Greatest Generation</a> produced one of America's most self-absorbed.  The baby boomers were so "traumatized" by <em>their</em> war, but completely ignored the war of their fathers.  A war that not only altered individuals, but changed the whole landscape of the world as we know it.  It took the next generation after them to honor the sacrifice of their parents...</p>

<p>
I'm not trying to take away anything from the men and women who served in Vietnam.  What they did was unimaginable to me.  But the way the society as a whole handled that war versus the way they have handled WWII until recently is appalling to me.</p>

        <title>A Simoni - Cunego rift in Team Saeco?</title>

After yesterday's stage win by Cunego, Simoni complained that his teammate had chased him down to force the field sprint at the end.  Sounds like Simoni might be a little spoiled.  Did he really think that Cunego would just let the 2nd place rider ride off?  It will be interesting to see how this develops before the Tour de France.</p>

Most folks probably barely noticed them on the way in from the Northland, but the last few mornings there have been crews of workers cleaning up, cutting down, and generally "<em>beautifying</em>" the medians and shoulders of 169.  Thanks to these hard working souls, the roadway now looks less like a jungle trail, and more like modern highway.</p>

So here's to you... Mr. Roadside Grass Cutter Guy!</p>

I'm still here, just been busy.  I'm talking with <a href="http://mosdoc.mamboserver.com/wakka.php?wakka=Andrew_Eddie&amp;v=ibc">Andrew Eddie</a> about a new project / task management software.  We're still trying to work out what it will be, but it looks like it will be powered off of the Mambo core and probably distributed as custom Mambo install.  Definitely some cool stuff.</p>

<p>
In other news, the California Supreme Court is <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/sfmarriages/">hearing a case on same-sex marriages</a> in San Francisco.  I listened to a portion of the debates this morning over lunch.  Riveting...  Well, it's better than the TV version of a court.  Plus these cases do more than effect the underlying story line of a series, there is actual effects to real people.  If you've never watched a Supreme Court case on TV, it's worth a watch.</p>

Bush in mountain bike tumble<br /><br />
23/05/2004 - 09:06:45  <br /><br /><br />
President George W Bush suffered cuts and bruises when he fell while mountain <br />
biking on his ranch, White House spokesman Trent Duffy said.<br /><br />
<br />
Duffy said Bush was riding on Saturday with a military aide, members of the <br /><br />
Secret Service and his personal physician, Dr Richard Tubb.<br /><br /><br />
?He had minor abrasions and scratches on his chin, upper lip, nose, right <br />
hand and both knees,? Duffy said.<br /><br />
<br />
?Dr Tubb, who was with him, cleaned his scratches, said he was fine. The <br /><br />
Secret Service offered to drive him back to the house. He declined and finished <br />
his ride.?<br /><br />
<br />
President Bush was wearing his bike helmet and a mouth guard when the mishap <br /><br />
occurred at the ranch in Crawford, Texas. Duffy said he did not know exactly <br />
how the accident happened.<br /><br />
<br />
?It?s been raining a lot and the topsoil is loose,? the spokesman said. ?<br /><br />
You know this president. He likes to go all out. Suffice it to say he wasn?t <br />
whistling show tunes.?<br /><br />
<br />
President Bush left Crawford shortly after the bike mishap for Austin, where <br /><br />
he was attending a private party of his daughter, Jenna, who graduated from <br />
the University of Texas earlier in the day.<br /><br />
<br />
When he arrived in Austin, Bush was not wearing any bandages, although <br /><br />
scrapes were visible on his right temple and on his chin.<br /><br /><br />
As he departed from the presidential helicopter with his wife, Bush paused to <br />
give photographers a chance to take his picture, then shrugged, waved and got <br /><br />
into a waiting limousine.<br /><br /><br />
Earlier this month, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry took a spill <br />
from his bicycle while riding with Secret Service agents through Concord, <br /><br />
Massachusetts. Kerry fell when his bike hit a patch of sand. He was not injured.<br /><br /><br />
Told about Bush?s mishap, Kerry said: ?I hope he?s okay. I didn?t know the <br />
president rode a bike.?<br /><br />
    <br />

Kerry takes a spill from bikeCONCORD, Mass. (AP) ? Democratic presidential <br />
candidate John Kerry took a spill from his bicycle after hitting a patch of sand <br /><br />
during a ride Sunday afternoon, but he was uninjured, campaign officials <br />
said. <br /><br />
    <br />
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry rides his bicycle along a path <br /><br />
on the Longfellow Bridge in Boston.  Steven Senne, AP <br /><br /><br />
<br />
Kerry was riding south on a two-lane road at about 1:00 p.m. in the direction <br /><br />
of Walden Pond State Reservation in Concord, a quiet, suburban town about 18 <br />
miles northwest of Boston. He was approaching a stop light at the intersection <br /><br />
with Route 2 and was slowing down when he veered left into the oncoming lane <br />
and fell, according to an Associated Press reporter who witnessed him fall. <br /><br />
Secret Service agents and local police immediately stopped traffic while Kerry <br />
and a handful of bicycling companions moved to the shoulder. "He's fine. They <br /><br />
took the bike into the bike shop, and he went home," said Kerry campaign <br />
adviser Michael Meehan. The Massachusetts senator was riding his custom Serotta <br /><br />
bicycle, and was wearing a helmet. Kerry had returned to Massachusetts, where he <br />
has a home in Boston's posh Beacon Hill section, for a break from the campaign <br /><br />
trail. Kerry, 60, rides his bicycle as often as he can get free time on the <br />
campaign trail. He even brings it along with him on the campaign plane. <br /><br />

Welp, the calm before the storm is officially over.  My computer's a wreck.  I can't do anything with it.  The cause you ask?  My <em>Win key</em> doesn't work! :(  Ok... so it isn't disabling my computer, but it is quite annoying.  I had my keyboard all set up just like I liked it.  I could Win+Tab to flip through desktops, and Shift+Win+Tab through 'em backwards.  The world was at peace and all was well.  Then my Win key broke.</p>

<p>
Another thing that gets on my nerves is <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora's</a> menu system.  I had gotten quite used to KDE's menu structure which makes a lot of sense and has everything where you'd expect it.  Now everything's moved on me...</p>

<p>
Oh, and there is one thing that does actually cause some trouble.  For some reason I am unable to add menu items on my home machine.  It didn't happen at work, but here I'm not adding anything to the menu.  Well, I'm not adding anything that is going to stay when I close it.</p>

<p>
Ahh... the many joys of the bleeding edge.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
My Dad's <a href="http://www.toyotaliftmidamerica.com/">company</a> had asked me to price laptops for their new sales person.  Last November, I helped them pick out a Dell laptop for my Dad and apparently they liked what I did.  Instead of jumping on the first good price I saw and recommending it, I decided to make the voyage down into <a href="http://www.opkansas.org/">Overland Park</a> to visit <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/">Microcenter</a> to check prices.  Sure, I could do that online, but I wanted something to do. :)</p>

<p>
While wondering around the vast supplies of computerdom that they carry, it finally dawned on me.  Microcenter is this generation's <a href="http://www.pepboys.com/">Pep Boys</a>.  Pep Boys offers to previous generations what Microcenter offers to mine - the supplies to further tinker with the technology of your generation.  Granted, this epiphany didn't come all on my own.  It was helped by reading the <a href="http://blogspace.com/freeculture/Mere_Copyists">Mere Copyists</a> chapter of Lessig's Free Culture.</p>

<p>
Anywho... That's my epiphany for now. :)</p>

Who would think that the opening of a newfangled and, as yet, uncompleted shopping center would cause a traffic jam?  Who would indeed.  I knew <a href="http://www.zonarosa.com/">Zona Rosa</a> was nearing completion and since I was in the neighborhood checking my P.O. Box, I thought I'd drive over and see what was going on.  Little did I know that it was now "<em>officially</em>" open.  The parking lot was a zoo, people were walking everywhere.  The line of traffic to get out of the place was horrible - only one lane leading into two turn lanes back toward the Interstate.  It was something else...</p>

<p>
I'm not really all that impressed by Zona Rosa.  Once the <a href="http://www.bn.com/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> opens maybe I'll change my mind as at least then there will be something worth going to down there.  It really seems like a knock-off of the <a href="http://www.countryclubplaza.com/">Plaza</a>, a bad one at that.  The Plaza has a entrances and exits going every which way; Zona Rosa on the other hand has one, and tonight at least it was very congested.  The Plaza has big name stores galore; the biggest name at Zona Rosa is <a href="http://www.bn.com/">B&amp;N</a>.  It's definitely something interesting to have around, but I don't think it will be a place that will be on my "to visit" list when out-ot-town guests are in town for the weekend.</p>

<p>
Think again.  Those bastards are going after college kids who create search engines.  Search engines which don't censor what is put on them.  University search engines that index all of the files students and faculty have made available.  Yup.  Folks "<em>never promoted piracy</em>" but an easy to push over - legally speaking - college student is what makes you a target.  That's who this cowardly, illegitimate, son-of-bitch, bastards are going after.  By the way - did I mention I don't have a very high opinion of these gestapo?  Bastards - they should castrated on sight with dull knives and sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_prison">Abu Ghraib</a> with notes saying they are former Saddam legal aid.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
This morning on the news I heard that a cell phone directory is in the works.  Opponents are many.  But one member of the opponents suprised the commentator, <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Verizon Wireless</a>.  The explaination for their concern was that their cell phone customers would be inundated with unwanted calls and text messages.  I think the concern is more closely rooted to their bottom line.</p>

<p>
Imagine this, the year is 2005, it is mid-summer.  A class action lawsuit has just come before the courts in which Verizon Wireless is the defendant.  The suit charges that Verizon Wireless is unfairly charging its customers by charging them for incoming calls and text messages, particuarlly when those calls are unwanted.  Right now, Verizon makes $.02 off of each incoming text message, so it the lawyers claim they profitting by these unsolicieted emails that they have done nothing to stop.</p>

<p>
The jurors, whose distaste for the American corporation runs deep, find for the plaintifs and as part of the settlement Verizon has to stop charging for all incoming messages and phone calls.  Verizon loses big!</p>

<p>
Possible?  I would say yes.  Probable, who knows.  But I think Verizon is covering their butts - "...but, your honor, we opposed the directory whereby the marketers got our customer's numbers.  We can't be held responsible for something we didn't want either."</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I'm going to start keeping track of some of my cycling adventures here.  I know there's a whole slew of people who are waiting impatiently for these, so here we go.</p>

<p>
Last night (Tuesday), I did my first group ride in the rain here in KC.  In all honesty, riding for two hours in on and off rain here was better than 15 minutes of rain in El Paso!  The roads in EP get nasty when it rains, grime and gunk and oily stuff that you don't even want to ask what is... just plain ugly.  Here, the roads are kept pretty clean because of all of the rain we get.</p>

<p>
Anyhow, turned out to be a pretty good ride.  I met Mike from over at <a href="http://www.cowtowncycling.com/">Cowtown Cycling</a>, who turns out to be the webmaster over there.  We had a nice visit after <a href="http://cowtowncycling.com/ipw-web/gallery/2004SpringFling4/DSC02661">Ed</a> decided to turn up the juice.  Mike told me to email 'em about joining, that they're always looking for new riders/racers.  I just don't know if I could pull on a <a href="http://cowtowncycling.com/ipw-web/gallery/2004SpringFling4/DSCF0597">cow-print jersey</a> every weekend :)</p>

<p>
It was a good ride, though.  We averaged just over 20 mph for the whole ride.  It would have been better had me and Mike not sat up and talked for 15 minutes.  I'm getting my legs back under, that's for sure.  The only thing that's throwing me right now is that it takes between 30 and 45 minutes of riding for me to get warmed up.  I guess I'm just getting old...</p>

Wow!  Newsflash! Newsflash!  Linus didn't write Linux! 88| 88|  What next?!  OJ really did kill Nicole?</p>

<fieldset><legend>Quote</legend>Kenneth Brown, president of AdTI, claims that Linux is based on intellectual property "often taken or adapted without permission from material owned by other companies and individuals."</fieldset>

<p>
And Linus even goes on to admit it!</p>

<fieldset><p><legend>Linus Torvalds comes clean</legend></p>
<p>
"OK, I admit it. I was just a front man for the real fathers of Linux: the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. They (for obvious reasons) couldn't step forward to admit that they had gotten bitten by the computer bug and had been developing a series of operating systems on their own during the off-season.</p>

<p>
"But when they started with Linux (which they originally called Freax?they do feel like outsiders, you know, and that's a whole sad story in itself), they felt that they could no longer just let it languish in obscurity.</p>

<p>
"They started to look for a front man, and since Santa Claus is from Finland, and thus has connections to Helsinki University, and the Easter Bunny claimed, 'He's got good ears, if a bit small,' I got selected.</p>

<p>
"Since then, I've lived a life of subterfuge, always afraid that somebody would find out the truth. I'm actually relieved that it's over, and that the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution has finally uncovered the lie. I can now go back to my chosen profession, the exploration of the fascinating mating dance of the aquatic African frog."</p></fieldset>

<p>
How? Oh, how could you betray us like this?!</p>

<em>Mirror Access<br />
<br />
The following mirrors carry Fedora Core:</em></p>

<p>
Ever doubt the power that open source software exerts on the Internet?  Just check out what <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 2</a> is doing to servers around the nation.  Visit the <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/download/mirrors.html">Fedora mirrors</a> page and try to connect to any US server.  You can't.  And it's past midnight on the east coast!</p>

<p>
But I've got a secret... I'm currently downloading all four of the ISO (files that make CDs) at the full speed of my Road Runner cable modem.  So what's my secret to the speedy download of the hottest Linux distribution?  Foreign power, baby.  Most folks don't want to download from overseas because they think it'll be slower.  <strong>Hogwash!</strong></p>

<p>
The connections between countries is just as strong as the ones between states.  Right now I'm downloading from Germany, the Czech Republic, Iceland, and I think France.  All of 'em on the first try, and all of 'em as fast as my cable modem will let me.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I'm working on it.  When I first read this article, my <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22&amp;num=100">Google Number</a> was just under 100, now I'm up to 594.  Well, actually, it's 592, because two of the entries on the geneology website aren't mind.  Anyhow, according to this article, I still shouldn't "hang my shingle" just yet.  I'm getting there though.</p>

<p>
For those who are interested, you can find your <em>Google Number</em> by going to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a>, and searching for your name inside quotation marks.  If you have a common name, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Jason%20Murphy%22">Jason Murphy</a>, you may need to include some strings to subtract out all of the other folks.  To do that, just add "-snowboard", or whatever other phrase keeps coming up talking about people that aren't you.  Some of us are lucky though, there's not much activity online by the other Travis Swicegood of the world.  And since I share my name with only one living person (that I know of), I think I'm pretty safe.</p>

The Democratics in Missouri have caused a stir.  The billboard which has just made the news has been up on my way home from work for the past few days.  The Rebpulicans are upset saying it's race baiting.  The Democrats defend their billboard saying it is just the first of many different portraits.  Interesting that those choice for their first billboard though... </p>

<p>
<em>Note to Democratic party</em>: You should have had a multi-racial group of kids on the first billboard.  There would have been very little recourse from the Republicans, it would have been safer, and you could still roll out the current billbaord.</p>

On my way home from work today I was listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> - yes, I do have a habit called NPR - and they <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/">All Things Considered</a> had a very provocative piece called <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1899657">Brown v. Board: Letters to Eisenhower</a> which consisted of approximately 10 minutes of letters addressed to the then President in the wake of the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling.  Many were for, many were against, but they all offered a glimpse into a not-so-distant past what we would do well to remember.</p>

<fieldset>
<legend>Intro to NPR piece</legend><br />
Fifty years ago today, the United States Supreme Court condemned separate schools for black and white children. The decision in the case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka was a turning point in the nation's history.</fieldset>

<img class="imgRight" src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/helios.jpg" border="0" alt="Helios - a solar powered flying antenna" />  Wow, this is one of the coolest things I've seen in a while!  The <a href="http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Research/Erast/helios.html">Helios</a> from NASAS is essentially a solar-powered, flying antenna!  It transmits wireless singles to phones, computer receivers, radio receivers (or it could), or any other number of things that need data transferred to them.  It works better than a satellite as there is no launch, it takes off of its own power, and can sustain over long periods of time as it's fuel - electricity - is generated from the solar panels that cover its hughe 247 foot wingspan.</p>

<p>
The deployment of these, or similar machines that come from this research could very easily revolution the wireless world.  Instead of having to rely on being near a mobile tower with only 4 miles of coverage, all you need to do is be near one of these machines that can broadcast and receive signals up to 10 miles away.  Very cool...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Today marks the first day gay and lesbian couples can legally marry in Massachusetts.  Today's date seemed arbitrary to all but a few when on February 4th, 2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/gaymarriage.html">same-sex marriage</a> was in fact allowed by the Massachusetts constitution stating that:</p>

<fieldset><legend>Quote from ruling</legend>Barred access to the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community's most rewarding and cherished institutions. That exclusion is incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equality under law.</fieldset>

<p>
The astute observer realized then, as has just dawned on me today, that today's date had to be intentional.  Judges at the state and Federal level are students of history, their job requires it.  The Supreme Court Justices in Massachusetts choose today as the day that same-sex marriages had to be recognized because today marks the 50th anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education.  Today, another great step forward in equality for all has been taken.</p>

<p>
"<em>Separate but equal is legal fiction.</em>"</p>

<p>
Those words, spoken today by President Bush apply specifically to the issue of same-sex marriage versus same-sex unions.  But those words were not those of President Bush; he was quoting Thurgood Marshall's brief to the United States Supreme Court when Marshall made his case that segregation was not equality.  Words, spoken more than fifty years ago, but they still describe the fallacy of bigotry.  A bigotry that has just changed its focus over the last fifty years.</p>

Today makes the 50th anniversary of <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/brown.html">Brown vs. Board of Education</a>.  On my way to lunch this afternoon, I listened to a portion of the Brown vs. Board of Education ceremony in Kansas.  The <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/">governor of Kansas</a>, Kathleen Sebelius, gave an excellent speech, with one exception.  She called for continued action to insure that each child receives the quality education that they are entitled to but failed to explain how she planned on making that call to action a reality within Kansas.  It's easy to say every child should receive the world's best education, it's a beast entirely different to explain how to go about that.</p>

<p>
On a side note, while I can't get a copy of Governor Sebelius' speech from this afternoon through your web site, in fact the <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/speeches.html">speeches</a> section of her site lists her last speech as the <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/news/docs/stateofstate_011204.html">2004 Kansas State of the State Address</a>, I can see in the <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/currentnews.html">current new</a> section that she "shot her first turkey".  Hmm, makes one wonder if the web site is there for informational purposes or to promote her to the NRA...</p>

Petacchi takes another stage win today.  The commentators said he was "looking too cool" with 400 meters to go as he didn't immediately cover the final attack.  His guy who was playing it cool ended up a half a bike length in front of his nearest challenger and nearly three in front of the original attacker, Pollack who finished 4th.</p>

<p>
On another note, McEwen got disqualified in today's finish.  He got a push from one of his team mates which catapulted him from about 10th to Petacchi's wheel.</p>

        <title>Free Culture by Lawrence Lessig</title>

        <updated>2004-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/05/16/free_culture_by_lawrence_lessig</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I'm working on a new book, <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a> by <a href="http://www.lessig.org">Lawrence Lessig</a>.  Dumb me, I actually paid for the book.  It's available for under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> to download for free. :)</p>

<p>
It looks to be an interesting read.  It deals with the current situation with "<em>property rights</em>", property being intellectual, creative, and otherwise.  I've made it through the first chapter, and Lessig has an interesting style.  His writing could be more concise, but he seems to be a thorough writer and wants to insure that his readers fully understand the points he makes.  He's a law professor at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, so what should I have expected?  He does have a habit to start to make excellent points and at the very instance your head wraps itself around the idea and says, "Ah-ha, I see where he's going..." he drops it.</p>

<p>
At one point towards the end of the first chapter he mentions building and I have the sudden flash of insight.  The discussion on "building" upon what has come before is mentioned in a way that building briefly seems as though it is meant in its noun form.  This split-second image of a building gives me the insight that current property laws work along these lines: A lumber yard licenses the wood for a specific building, but any other use of the wood is prohibited.  The scraps can not be turned into trinkets for the house, as the wood was only licensed for framework and structure purposes.  Many of the "<em>licenses</em>" that popular culture - software, music, movies - come under have just the same purpose.  Here, you have purchased our product but you can only use it this way.  Any other use might get the RIAA (insert appropriate other "<em>association</em></p>

<p>
The work is available completely under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/1.0/">Attribution / Non-Commercial</a> license, so anyone who so desired could take the book and "simplify" it.  My judgement might be premature.  Time will tell...</p>

<a href="http://fplanque.net">Francois</a> pulled a fast one on us!  He released v0.9 a day early for us Americans! :)  Grab your copy today (or bug me to install it as the case may be Sarah...).  Looks like there's a whole host of new features.  This site, as well as <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws">Crossroads</a> will be switching over soon.</p>

        <title>Yahoo's all about this Travis</title>

Well, that was pretty nifty.  Launching this site and the announcement that appeared on my <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a> blog moved me up in the rankings on the Yahoo! search for "<em>Travis</em>".  Now the only site I have to dethrone is the band <em>Travis</em>.  Watch out <em>Travis</em> the band, I'm coming after you! :)</p>

<p>
P.S.  Yes, it is shameless self (that would be me, <em>Travis</em>) promotion.  I want this site (that would be <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis Swicegood dot com</a>) in there, too.  So I'm seeing how many times I can legitimately put my name (<em>Travis</em>, that is), in a post.  You see, it would be cheating just to act like a Brady Bunch girl and say Travis, Travis, Travis...  Plus I don't know if the search engines would like that.  Anyhow, this is Travis - Travis Swicegood that is - signing off.</p>

<p>
In case you don't want to count how many times I mention <em>Travis</em> in the above two paragraphs - there are 11 instances of <em>Travis</em>.  And that's not counting the three times <em>Travis</em> is mentioned in this paragraph! ;)</p>

<p>
Ok, so "Hey baby, you should Yahoo! my name.  Yeah, it's #1." isn't going to get me any dates, or at least any dates that I would want, but it's still cool!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Italian and Simoni's Saeco teammate pulls off the win and pulls on the pink jersey at the top of stage 7.  Cunego covered every attack on the slopes of Montevergine, never helping anyone as they badgered Simoni all the way up.  Cunego was picked by many to win the stage today, but OLN's commentators had their doubts until they saw him cover each attack with ease.  Cunego is in his second Giro.  The youngest rider in the field last year's Giro, he is only "22.6" years old!  Figueras attacked every other kilometer it seemed, but in the end was unable to hold Cunego.

        <id>http://travisswicegood.com/2004/05/14/may_10th_is_stick_it_to_them_day</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've gotten a few emails over the <em>Stick it to them day</em> that is supposed to take place on May 19th.  It's a great idea, but it doesn't go far enough.  If you really want to hurt the oil companies, don't drive your car at all on the 19th.  All you do by not purchasing on the 19th yet still drive is delay the money flow into the oil company's pockets. <br /></p>
<!--more--><p><br /></p>
<fieldset><legend>May 19th "Stick it to them day" email</legend>It has been calculated that if everyone in the United States did not purchase a drop of gasoline for one day and all at the same time, the oil companies would choke on their stockpiles.<br /><br /><br />
At the same time it would hit the entire industry with a net loss of over 4.6 billion dollars which affects the bottom lines of the oil companies.<br /><br /><br />
Therefore may 19th has been formally declared "<em>Stick it to Them  Day</em>" and the people of this nation should not buy a single drop of gasoline that<br />
day.<br /><br />
<br />
The only way this can be done is if you forward this e-mail to as many people as you can and as quickly as you can to get the word out.<br /><br />
<br />
Waiting on this administration to step in and control the prices is not going to happen. What happened to the reduction and control in prices that the arab nations promised two weeks ago?<br /><br />
<br />
Remember one thing, not only is the price of gasoline going up but at the same time airlines are forced to raise their prices, trucking companies are forced to raise their prices which effects prices on everything that is shipped. things like food, clothing, building materials, medical supplies etc. Who pays in the end? we do!<br /><br />
<br />
We can make a difference. if they don't get the  message after one day, we will do it again and again.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So do your part and spread the word. Forward this email to everyone you  know.  Mark your calendars and make may 19th a day that the citizens of the United States say "enough is enough".</fieldset>

Seems simple enough, phpList is supposed to support creating an email newsletter from an RSS feed straight out of the box.  Well that's what they say.  I've fiddled with it for a good 30 minutes (after I had it setup and running).  I just can't get it to send a message from my RSS feed.  I'm kind of disappointed as I was hoping to offer RSS feeds via email for folks who don't have or wouldn't know how to setup a feed reader.  Oh well...</p>

Kansas City (courtesy of the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com">Kansas City Star</a>)</span><br />
<br />
Welp, it seems I was the first in blogland to bring you the story, and it looks like it's going to happen.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Quote from <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/8649301.htm?1c">Kansas City Star</a></legend><br />
Mayor Kay Barnes today unveiled plans for a $225 million to $250 million downtown arena, saying nearly half the financing will come from Anschutz Entertainment Group, Sprint Corp., and the National Association of Basketball Coaches.</fieldset>

<p>
In the <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=kr-kcsports&amp;msg=31659.1&amp;ctx=4096">forum topic</a> about the announcement, the only complaint I saw that it was too small.  It's scheduled to have between 15,000 and 20,000 seats.  <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/dir-app/bbcard/profile.asp?webtag=kr-kcsports&amp;uid=421838537">kiimo</a>, the poster, wants to see a 35,000 seat arena.</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=kr-kcsports&amp;msg=31660.1&amp;ctx=1">poll</a> the star is running asks readers what they want to see in the arena.  56% are hoping for an NBA team.</p>

<p>
This is big news for KC. The entire first half of the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/">Kansas City Star website</a> right now is dedicated to this story.  It'll be interesting to see if it has the favor of KC residents when it is put to the ballot on August 3rd.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Went for a ride tonight.  Great stuff, huh?  The Northland in Kansas City is really great for cycling.  There's a multitude of empty country roads where you can pedal to your heart's content.  The only thing that messes up this cycle-induced nirvana are the self-absorbed roadiacs (it's my blog, I can make up words if I want) who speed their souped up family <a href="http://www.pontiac.com/grandam/index.jsp?brand=home&amp;pagename=home">sedans</a> or quasi-military vehicles (I would link, but I don't want to subject you to the flash intro at Hummer.com) along with no care in the world about anyone else.  "Hell, if I get in an accident, it ain't me that's going to get hurt.  The momentum's with me and/or I'll just run 'em over."</p>

<p>
It's not that I have a thing against those types of cars.  I love a big utility vehicle or fast car as much as the next guy.  It's the self-absorbedness that they represent.  Most people don't need a car that can do -6 second 0-60 runs.  Most people don't need a vehicle that can be dropped from a helicopter at 1000 feet and still be drivable.  They just want the vehicle, the environment and other motorists be damned.</p>

<p>
But who cares...?  Right?  It's not like the money that they pump into those vehicles every other day at the gas station does any harm.  I mean, terrorists aren't in OPEC.  No... the contractors that set the pipe lines in Saudi don't actually have any ties to Al Qaeda.  Oh wait, they do?  Then I guess the self-absorbed individuals who are too busy with their own life to be courteous when they pass me on my bike are funding terrorism, too.  And here I was just thinking they were inconsiderate.</p>

I'm getting tired of hearing about the abuse in Iraq.  Not because I'm a bury my head in the sand kind of guy who doesn't like to hear bad news.  Quite the contrary.  I'm getting tired of it because all of the focus is on the soldiers.  In the military, there is a chain of command, and everyone is responsible for everyone below them.  Do you honestly think that some reservists are going to pose with prisoners and take pictures without their superiors knowing about it?  And if they did do on their own, the commander(s) should be held accountable for not knowing what was going on.</p>

<p>
Before the invasion of Normandy, then General Eisenhower prepared two letters (or speeches my memory fails me on the exacts).  Anyway, in them he prepared one for success saying that with the invasion of Normandy the Allies had started to take back Europe.  The other letter he prepared offered his resignation and apologies to the President and the Allies.  This was a military man who realized that he was ultimately responsible for the success and failure of his troops.  Some of those in command in Iraq and Washington should take a page out of the history books and remember that they are the ones in charge which makes this responsible.</p>

I'm starting to get feed up with <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>.  They keep toying with me.  One minute I'm a hot commodity, the next I'm nowhere to be found.  I'm talking about the Yahoo! search for "Travis".  I've been as high as 3rd, and so low I couldn't even find myself.  The site that has been listed is <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a>.</p>

<p>
What really got me is that for a few days, I was ousted by someone who had registerd the .com of my name and hadn't event put a site up.  The only references to "Travis" on the site were "<em>Welcome to your new website: insertdomain.com</em>".  Yahoo has now fixed their search algorithm to not include sites like that, but the constant r fluctuation just goes to show how under construction their search still is.</p>

<p>
In the meantime, this site should give me the ranking I desire.  Not only is my name prominently displayed on the site, it's the domain name.  So, keep an eye on <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=Travis">Yahoo!</a>, you're favorite <em>Travis</em> might just be showing up.</p>

After taking Mom out for Mother's Day, I did a little picture taking.  I've found a neat little "waterfall" and a cool old railroad bridge.  Look for pictures coming soon to <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">Me And Travis</a>.</p>

Happy Mother's Day to all you moms out there.  Yesterday, I gave probably the best mother's day gift of all time!  What is it you ask?  Flowers?  A dozen roses?  A trip to a day spa (I actually thought about that!)?  A trip to Hawaii?  No!  None of those come nearly as close to what I got her.</p>

<p>
A <strong>Gary Fisher Tiburon</strong> bike! :)  I've been hassling my mom to ride a bike more often but she kept saying she didn't have a bike (a valid argument I guess).  She's the type who would never spend the money to buy a Wal-Mart bike, much less a good one, so I decided to do it for her.  She even took it for a spin the first night!</p>

<p>
This just proves that a good bike is always the best gift to give :)</p>

        <title>Longhorn to Mozilla: Can't We All Get Along?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft's technology evangelist is offering "friendly" suggestions to Mozilla open source browser groups and calling for more discussion about how the two sides can benefit from upcoming enhancements in Longhorn, the next version of Windows.</p></blockquote>

<p>
It appears Microsoft is trying to make nice with the folks over at Mozilla.  Could it just be a wolf in sheeps clothing?  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> represents a real threat to Internet Explorer.  Maybe by bringing the enemy into the same camp they can attempt play the ol' "why go to a 3rd-party when we're the source" argument.</p>

<p>
It'll be interesting to see how this develops.</p>

        <title>BlogKC ? KCPD speeder crackdown</title>
        <link href="http://travisswicegood.com/2004/05/07/blogkc_r_kcpd_speeder_crackdown/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
And I saw my first "crackdown" today.  On south 169 heading into Downtown, a KCMO police car came up and tailed a motorcycle who was obviously speeding in the 55 zone (he passed me and I was going 60+) until he hit the 35 zone and busted him.</p>

<p>
Brings up an ethical question.  Is it alright for a cop to observe a "crime" and do nothing about it waiting for a bigger, or in this case more lucrative as far as the department is concerned, crime to be committed?</p>
