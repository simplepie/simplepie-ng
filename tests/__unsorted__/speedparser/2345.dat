			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst chaordinating (a word I keep slipping into sentences, and nobody even flinches, I hope they&#8217;re not hearing coordinating, or they&#8217;re missing the point) a truly epic event (which I really should write something about) with <a href="http://www.ks12.net/">Gabriel Shalom</a> (I should note we have 22 other collaborators, but this particular discussion was between the two of us).  We were trying to map the relationships between different individual, machines and activities in order to better understand the connections and opportunities between participants and how to arrange the space.</p>
<p>We had what could&#8217;ve been a very lengthy discussion about what process to use. Instead it went something like this.</p>
<p>Gabriel &#8211; I&#8217;m interested to use <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/institute/">compendium</a> (Gabriel please let me know what it was called), because it allows me to make the meta connections and links. To view layers of information and to view multiple levels of association. There is also an advantage long term in ease of sharing/connection.</p>
<p>Me &#8211; I want to use post-its and paper because I can shuffle the information around in the physical plane, plus I find that since tools define the outcome in their use I find the real world a more creative space in which to think.</p>
<p>At this point we could see the merit in each others argument, but each of us felt stronger that their way was better. So we tried a different solution.</p>
<p>Realising that we could be discussing the merits of different process for hours, instead we agreed to develop in parallel (this is something that I&#8217;m also using for a range of other projects, having decided that too much conversation sucks balls when trying to get stuff done, and that sometimes it&#8217;s quicker to do everything at once than it is to talk about who&#8217;s right).</p>
<p>So I noted down the information on different coloured post-its, reading them out to Gabriel as I did so, he then created links and meta connections on his computer. I shuffled post-its, he shuffled pixels.</p>
<p>By then observing each others process we were able to see patterns emerge. By not working on the computer with Gabriel we optimised development time, and arrived at a result which was both easily transferable and digitally communicable, but at the same time wouldn&#8217;t have emerged if the computer had dictated the pattern of layout.</p>
<p>Even if the processes had not been complimentary, we still would&#8217;ve arrived at an outcome, and far more quickly than if we had only chosen one methodology (because we cut out all the discussion).</p>
<p>We had a phrase at <a href="http://www.palomar5.org">Palomar 5</a> marked by a grave &#8211; <a href="http://www.palomar5.org">&#8220;</a>concensus killed my idea&#8221;, parallel process collaboration arose from this thinking on how to proceed without concensus. The answer is just to proceed, with people addressing the issues in the manner they think is most effective, communicating what they have learned and are doing as they go. No blocking, no right way, only your way in parallel with everybody else&#8217;s. Normally everybody is moving in the same direction, some people will arrive more quickly, others amble, some will discover dead ends, others hidden gems. It needed be a march, or a three legged race, it&#8217;s possible to work together yet separately &#8211; this is the path to autonomy.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important is the goal, or the region of exploration, if you have opposing outcomes then parallel process won&#8217;t work. However in a collaborative context it is an awesome weapon against consensus. Big hat tip to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chris_doering">Christopher Doering</a> who was a big part in these discussions whilst at P5 and I believe responsible for the grave marker.</p>
<p>Note to Gabriel: Several options by way of reply &#8211; propose edits in comments, write your own blog response and I&#8217;ll link. Would be great to have your input and thoughts on the process.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A terrorist cell acts autonomously, with little communication. It acts according to a strong intrinsically motivated belief system, with a clearly defined objective &#8211; terror and disruption. It matters not how the objective is achieved, only that the objective is achieved. Knowledge is shared and innovation encouraged.</p>
<p>What has this got to do with business? Am I proposing businesses build bombs &#8211; no (besides many have found far more effective ways of being socially destructive). However I am suggesting that in the future businesses operating as a network, will prove to be far more effective than those which are centrally organised and managed, especially if they can address the intrinsic motivation issue.</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong><br />
By this I mean that you should seek to understand the motivations and human passions of your network (read employees, if still old thinking), not that you should seek to make your business goals an intrinsic motivation. This is about alignment not supplication.</p>
<p>If people are working, governed by intrinsic motivations (AKA passions, beliefs), then they will care about their work and strive to produce the best they can. They will not just be in it for the money.</p>
<p><strong>Clear objectives</strong><br />
Clear objectives that allow for interpretation as to how an action is carried out, but a definition of what a successful outcome looks like, will ensure that the network is free to operate and be flexible in it&#8217;s methods, provided that the objective is carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p><strong>Easily transferable knowledge</strong><br />
Sharing tools and technologies for efficiently achieving objectives, ensures that any network member can adapt to take up the role or position in absence of another member (resilient network). Such behavior runs counter to usual business culture, where the desire is to be indispensable. With the right incentives, in my opinion everybody should work to make themselves dispensable.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy<br />
</strong>The above contribute to generate autonomous behavior, intrinsic drivers ensure that the job gets done however it needs to be, easily transferable knowledge ensures that people have the know how needed to do it, and clear objectives ensure they know what has to be done.</p>
<p>This makes the lives of people trying to counter this behavior very difficult especially since they are fighting a network with an organisation.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROWE">Results only work environment</a> has taken some steps towards these principles, although intrinsic drivers are probably more based on &#8220;I want to spend more time with my family&#8221; rather than &#8220;this business is aligned with my moral principles&#8221;, but a step in the right direction none the less.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capitalism as a whole encourages psychopathic organisational behavior as illustrated very well in &#8220;The Business&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is not conspiracy only logic.</p>
<p>The economic system dictates behavior, our behavior (due to our understanding of this system) is often driven by money.</p>
<p>Where there is no longer a market, a market needs to be created. There is no interest to remove a market, as it removes your ability to make money. Whether or not this market is socially detrimental is not considered as a factor.</p>
<p>So Military Companies should definitely not be part of this system as it requires them to create the need for war.</p>
<p>Medical companies should not be part of this system as it is not in their interest to find outright cures (worse still is that the imperative for growth requires them to create diseases (mostly psychological warfare in this respect, by defining our human response to a messed up world as a disease).</p>
<p>Lawyers should not be part of the system as they need to create and encourage personal conflict in order to go to court (Which leads to a culture of blame, and absence of responsibility).</p>
<p>The media, surely we should find it bothersome that most of our information about our society is driven by sales, (which leads to sensationalism and promotion of antisocial role models) rather than what we should be informed about, not to mention the compromise and lack of objectivity brought about by advertisers, the political opinions of the editor/investors.</p>
<p>I could go on, but the principle can be applied to a range of fields.  There is very little that has no influence on our collective psyche and behavior. Where money dictates survival and success, and trumps all in our societical mindset, such issues will only continue. We need to re-evaluate all industries that work against our humanity, and make them our tools again, tools that are for us, not to shape us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve heard the phrase Human Resources a lot lately and I have to say it sticks in my throat.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it embodies the attitudes of corporations and all that is wrong with the system in the first place.</p>
<p>To see the human as a resource, is too see us as something to be owned, mined, optimized, used, and given mans behavior &#8211; exhausted.</p>
<p>If we are to change our approaches we must change our language as all words have associations. I recall a discussion with @axelletess and @maryannarogers, where after looking in depth at the problems of work they concluded they must change our associations with work and the word itself.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t go to work, I go to play. Likewise &#8220;Human Resources&#8221; must die.</p>
<p>So what goes in place of Human Resources, what do we replace this function with? What fills this absent space?</p>
<p>The enabler: A person that allows me to pursue my passions, to grow, to learn and to live. Someone who allows me to maintain my energy for a project, and to remove the obstacles in life and work that could reduce my momentum.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to extend the question to HR people. How would you feel about the above position? How do you feel about your job at the moment?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common enough question, but one I struggle to answer. When asked recently for a job title or description I flipantly wrote &#8220;google me&#8221;. Strangely I now have no title.</p>
<p>I believe that I&#8217;m not alone in this loose definition of self, in terms of work. I aspire to fluidity and therefore would rather not define myself, either in work or otherwise. Fluidity and no definition means that I can adopt role and function as and where necessary. To define oneself is to limit growth and change. So what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>I identify where I can be of most value and act accordingly. I see what needs to be done and do it, or find someone else to do it.</strong></p>
<p>What I do vs what I can do is an important distinction, I can do a lot, I could still do more, but if I needed to learn how to do it, I&#8217;m confident I could.</p>
<p>More recently I have found myself adopting the following roles:</p>
<p>Clarifier &#8211; I listen to long conversations and dialogues and then relay exactly what everybody is trying to say. I distill information into a pure and understandable form and translate between parties. I take the time to understand the geeks, geniuses and those so intelligent that others struggle to understand them.</p>
<p>Enabler &#8211; I identify what needs to happen for someone to achieve what they are setting out to do and either take action or assign action and make sure it happens. I unblock obstacles to flow to help get stuff done and maintain energy and passion.</p>
<p>Moderator &#8211; Ensuring that everybody gets to make their point (or someone else gets to make it for them)</p>
<p>Connector &#8211; Linking ideas, thoughts, people and projects</p>
<p>Designer for Humans &#8211; I work with whatever technology is best suited to solve a particular challenge. I do it from a Human perspective &#8211; ie. our social as well as physical selves, humans are far more than ergonomic factors. Separate blog post to follow.</p>
<p>Muse &#8211; A challenging role, people have to adopt ideas they feel passionately about, and they have to take ownership of it. You can&#8217;t give people ideas, they have to take them, want them, desire them, if they are not in love with it then it not succeed. They may love it for different reasons.</p>
<p>Social hacker &#8211; I hack social situations, change physical spaces, change behaviors, create permission to behave differently</p>
<p>Catalyst &#8211; I like to boost people, accelerate their advancement and those of their ideas, the faster people become self reliant and confident, the quicker you are not needed which leads me to the final role.</p>
<p>Redundancy designer &#8211; I aim to make my self unnecessary, I aim to reduce work, not increase it, so we can all spend more time playing. I can do the same for you.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s my job title? Water? Fire? Earth? Air? Human?</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m Jay, and tomorrow i&#8217;ll be Jay, but Jay will never be the same.</p>
<p>These roles are merely behaviors I adopt when necessary, behaviors are transferable, if you want to adopt some let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks to @villum for prompting this brain dump.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Etsy/Folksy/Dawanda meets Instructables</p>
<p>Open and distributed models of product development create an environment in which products can evolve, advance, and be produced as needed, where needed. However designers and innovators attitudes repeatedly return to &#8220;yes very nice, how am I going to get paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Financial reward does not flow from the idea, it flows from the market. Therefore a system which allows for both innovators, and producers to profit should be market focused. If the innovator owns the market, then they can allow anyone to create the goods and charge for them, but take a slice of the proceeds by managing the marketplace, and making it easier for producers to access the market through them, than it is to undertake the exercise themselves.</p>
<p>If someone wants to replicate the product it makes more sense to service the market, than it does to establish their own market. If a larger company wants to circumvent the system (indeed this is possible even with patents) then they could, however the products they would supply would be vastly different from those supplied by the marketplace (with the marketplace being able to offer a higher speed of innovation, diversity of product, service offering, and localised support). A clever company should recognise that by working with the market they can get the best of both worlds, combining skills to offer rapidly evolving products which benefit from scale of production. See diagram below for an explanation of how such a marketplace might function.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287" title="openinnovation" src="http://jaycousins.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/openinnovation1.png?w=500&#038;h=366" alt="openinnovation" width="500" height="366" /></p>
<p>By “owning” the marketplace, the innovator creates a focal point for their innovation, around which interested customers can gather. Producers can service the customers needs in a way that benefits them, with the innovator taking a slice for providing the virtual space in which this happens. Innovators can also derive profits from suppliers looking to serve both the “Producers market” and the “DIY customers market”. The innovator provides know-how to all parties, and also is responsible for creating the space and ensuring market growth.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s likely that for such a system to work, further elaboration will be required to include further actors &#8211; such as marketeers and evangelists. Also requiring exploration is what happens when someone builds upon an innovation, how is a fair system of reward maintained?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to Dougald Hines call for articles around the theme <a href="http://otherexcuses.blogspot.com/2008/09/call-for-submissions-commonsense.html">COMMONSense</a>. and this has been bubbling under for some time now, so it&#8217;s time to splurge.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property is theft</p>
<p>Let us not decieve ourselves any longer, all forms of property and property rights are about control and power. They change the rules of the world, and make us play zero sum games.</p>
<p>The fencing off and privatising of the &#8220;Commons&#8221; represents nothing less than theft from the community, it prevents the community from utilising a resource that belongs to us all. It artificially conveys rights to the priviledged and the powerful, enabling them to control the flow of resources. This applies to the Intellectual as well as the Physical Commons.</p>
<p>Ideas are not ours to possess, they are not our solitary creations. They&#8217;re built on foundations of years of prior thought, innovation and perception. An idea is just waiting to be spotted, just because there is a cost attached to look for it, doesn&#8217;t mean you have the right to it when you stumble across it. Proprietary rights prevent social advancement, imagine if we had IP before the wheel, the spade and the plough.</p>
<p>If restricting access to ideas and knowledge results in death, what right have we to put profit over people?</p>
<p>Freedom is a word touted by the Capitalist ecosystem, without commons access we are not free.</p>
