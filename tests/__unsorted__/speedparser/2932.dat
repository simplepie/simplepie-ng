		<description><![CDATA[Several months back I had a chance to sit down with Wesley Bao of <a href="http://www.coconutislandstudio.com/">Coconut Island</a> at their office in downtown Shanghai. They hosted Shanghai's Global Game Jam earlier this year and I was intrigued by their approach and values as an indie studio - they seemed to set Wesley and his colleagues apart from the vast majority of the game development scene across China.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coconut Island is odd for a homegrown studio &#8211; they target the international market almost exclusively, avoiding the Chinese market wherever they can. Is this the only way to have a &#8220;creative&#8221; independent studio in China?</p>
<p>Kill Screen posted my article and interview with Wesley <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/profile-coconut-island">here</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>A quick review I wrote for the Shanghai music/culture site <a href="http://www.wearestd.com/the-twisted-wonderland-of-mr-mcgee/">wearestd.com</a>.</em>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai-based game creator American McGee and his studio Spicy Horse (???) have just completed work on Alice: Madness Returns, a dark re-imagination of the classic Lewis Carroll story and the anticipated sequel to American McGee&#8217;s Alice.</p>
<p>Alice, released in 2000, had players diving into a macabre, dangerous Wonderland as a teenaged, gothy, loony Alice. She spends most of the game wielding a kitchen knife and looking crazed, while fending off the twisted inhabitants of an alternate Wonderland. Madness Returns brings us back into her psychosis as we try to keep Alice alive and sane.</p>
<p>In some ways, Alice 2 feels dated, but that isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. Gameplay centers on platforming-focused level design, 3D lock-on combat, and item collection &#8211; nothing new, but also solidly designed and appealingly nostalgic.</p>
<p>There are some modern touches. A now common gameplay trend has players discovering voice recordings from characters in the world as they progress, building a sense of place and history. In Madness Returns, you retrieve Alice&#8217;s memories of conversations past &#8211; a nice Eternal Sunshine-esque spin on the idea. She sifts through memories in Wonderland as her psychiatrist in London hypnotizes her to forget.</p>
<p>The real star is the art. The original Alice was known for surreal dreamscapes and Alice 2 maintains the tradition. The game begins in a stylized Victorian London that feels too familiar to be especially memorable, but soon you&#8217;re tumbling into Wonderland and the manifestations of Alice&#8217;s madness. The vivid views down the rabbit hole are a pleasure to behold. Transitioning from one area to the next almost feels too sudden; I found myself wanting to see more of what each landscape had to offer.</p>
<p>Some might find Madness Returns to be heavy-handed or conventionally morbid, and admittedly it isn&#8217;t much of a stretch to put a dark, violent twist on what is already vaguely menacing source material. The last ten years have given us experimental, subtly terrifying games like Tale of Tales&#8217; also fable-based The Path, and it might have been nice to see some similarly nuanced ambiguity in Alice&#8217;s narrative.</p>
<p>Mr. McGee and Spicy Horse have left a mark with a solid, aesthetically beautiful experience &#8211; Alice: Madness Returns does its predecessor proud. Nice work from our fellow Shanghai denizens &#8211; give it a spin if you feel like stepping through the ol&#8217; looking glass.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[These retranslations of the original Japanese text in <a href="http://www.glitterberri.com/the-legend-of-zelda/retranslation-redux">The Legend of Zelda</a> and <a href="http://www.glitterberri.com/adventure-of-link/retranslation">The Adventure of Link</a> by <a href="http://www.glitterberri.com/">Glitterberri</a> reminded me of a discussion about the comparative potential for Twitter's 140 characters across languages. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a language based on characters rather than a phonetic alphabet, you can generally communicate much more information in much less space. For example, Chinese tweets can carry much more complexity, and nuance than we can in English.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/thecave.jpg" alt="Thank goodness for Illustrator." /></center></p>
<p>Though there&#8217;s something to be said for the original English translation remaining in all-caps compared to the more comfortably legible lower-case of the new translation/interpretation, Glitterberri&#8217;s interpretation is undoubtedly more subtle and human, relying less on imperatives and incorporating more suggestion. Compare &#8220;YOU KNOW ALL I CAN TEACH YOU. GO.&#8221; with &#8220;I don’t have anything more to tell you. Go, and take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, &#8220;IT&#8217;S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE&#8221; retains its own sort of poetic, yet robotic quality. </p>
<p>For some reason, just like the lo-fi art and sound, it seems there are certain spaces left by poorly translated (by necessity or accident) or otherwise minimal text of that era that allowed our adolescent imaginations the room to more easily fill the gaps. </p>
<p>These spaces made playing these games an imaginative exercise &#8211; an experience of assisted make-believe &#8211; rather than being something that explicitly communicated a vision of another reality.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Like many others, I have been immersed in Portal 2 since it was released yesterday.  I absolutely loved the experience playing through single player mode and what I have seen of co-op thus far - the game serves as a strong reminder to why I want to dedicate my life to game creation.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that the praise is out of the way, I was surprised and somewhat appalled at the inclusion of a Team Fortress 2-like microtransaction store within the game.   That is, the Portal 2 store allows players to pay real money (usually $1 to $5) for arguably meaningless aesthetic changes to the two robots used in the co-op campaign.   These changes include skins, hats, gestures (unique animations used by the robots in-game), and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portal2store.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-798" title="Portal 2 Store" src="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portal2store.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>At first I brushed off the addition of the store as Valve giving players an opportunity to &#8220;donate&#8221; additional money to the developer if they were so inclined (with a minor incentive).   However upon some reflection, this simple answer doesn&#8217;t seem to make much sense.  Would enough players really be willing to pay real money to customize an avatar in a game that lasts under 5 hours (which also has relatively low replayability) to justify the effort of including a store system?  Is Valve banking on the gaming community&#8217;s love of Portal 2 to simply make some extra revenue?</p>
<p>Valve is known to be very business savvy while still greatly respecting their players. The only way I could picture the store being appreciated (and not scorned) by a large percentage of players is if Valve intends to add additional playable content&#8230; and lots of it.  Is the store a foundation for a turning Portal 2 into a platform of frequently updated, free content similar to Team Fortress 2?   By having the store built into the core of the game from launch, they are securing a slow-burning income model that could fund a team to consistently deliver content and support, the same model that has been proven to work with TF2.</p>
<p>These conclusions could simply be my respect for Valve obfuscating a very clear money-grab, but I remain hopeful.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Old, but an excellent talk from Soren Johnson of Civilization III and IV on "Fun" vs. "Good" AI.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IJcuQQ1eWWI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So much of the design for sophisticated games is based on that fragile, tenuous balance between &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;fun&#8221; AI. Simulation fidelity, abstraction and context, user experience and verisimilitude, etc. The Civilization series is an excellent example to highlight this.</p>
<p>The emphasis Firaxis places on the responsibility of the lead designer to also personally implement AI code among other game systems is something studios and current/prospective game designers should think long and hard about. Should a lead game designer on a AAA game be required to have lead-level gameplay programming skills?</p>
<p>Whether or not that is feasible, in most cases having a dedicated &#8220;idea person&#8221; is increasingly difficult to defend. What is the value of the pure &#8220;idea person&#8221; in a studio full of idea people, all in different disciplines with different actionable skills?</p>
<p>The traditional necessity for the &#8220;pure designer&#8221; is based on his/her presence within a highly segmented and specialized team &#8211; made up of developers with roles so specific that can be difficult for an individual to see the entire picture. There is still a place for massive teams with very specific skills, but the pure designer is still something of a rarity, and it should be that way &#8211; possibly increasingly so.</p>
<p>Brenda Braithwaite&#8217;s put out a compelling argument for the rising necessity of a strong programming foundation for would-be game designers:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://bbrathwaite.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/built-on-a-foundation-of-code-game-edu-rant/">Naturally, some students point to design docs or non-digital games to prove their prowess. This will no longer do – a design doc shows one thing only – that you can write a design document. There are countless ways for a game design to go wrong, and what matters is not your ability to think of an idea, but your ability to execute on that idea and bring it to life. Code is how a digital game is realized. Without it – and no matter how you represent it – you have only an idea for a game and 100 possible ways it can go wrong. The true art of game design is not in the idea, but in its implementation and the ability, dedication and determination to carry it through to the end while finding that nugget of fun. I have seen – and ignored – countless resumes with bulky design documents in favor of those who have actual running games.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To my knowledge, Firaxis is still relatively rare in that the lead gameplay programmer and the lead game designer seems to be in many respects the same person. This is of course not to discount the work of the actual engineering leads, who have their own skill sets and challenges to overcome &#8211; but the AI and basic game mechanics are what make each iteration of Civilization distinct as a game.</p>
<p>Will more developers take on the Firaxis model, as sophisticated programming for designers becomes increasingly crucial? The idea of game designers with their heads buried in design docs, occasionally emerging to code quick prototypes and doing minor scripting, may be increasingly irrelevant. Designers that rely less on the communication process lying between the designing of systems on paper and personally/implementing and testing them will mean for faster iteration, faster refinement, and greater feature ownership. Those sound to me like very good things.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This week Shanghai held its 16th <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/night/shanghai/16">Pecha Kucha</a> at the <a href="http://www.dutchdesignworkspace.com/">Dutch Design Workspace</a>, and The Pretentious Gamer came by to talk about how games and "gameness" are transcending each other.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>PechaKucha Night was devised in Tokyo in February 2003 as an event for young designers to meet, network, and show their work in public. It has turned into a massive celebration, with events happening in hundreds of cities around the world, inspiring creatives worldwide. Drawing its name from the Japanese term for the sound of &#8220;chit chat&#8221;, it rests on a presentation format that is based on a simple idea: 20 images x 20 seconds. It&#8217;s a format that makes presentations concise, and keeps things moving at a rapid pace.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being a mixed-discipline design-focused event, Pecha Kucha is a great opportunity to get non-game folks engaged with some of the ideas that are coming out of games and game culture, promote literacy of the medium, and hopefully get people to start playing as well. </p>
<p>20 slides at 20 seconds per slide and a lot of context to cover meant for a very fast, perhaps incoherent presentation. But here it is anyway.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[While in Paris, we managed to check out the <a href="http://museogames.com/">Museogames exhibition</a> at the incredible <a href="http://www.arts-et-metiers.net/">Musée des Arts et Métiers</a> (Museum of Arts and Crafts).]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/museogames12.JPG" alt="Museogames" /></p>
<p>The collection was a testament to careful preservation of the artifacts of the medium, and a statement on their cultural, artistic, and technical historical value &#8211; they &#8220;bear witness to the technical developments of their time; they have played an important role in our economic, social and cultural history and represent an essential link between the inventions that preceded them and those that were to come after them.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The show featured two collections brought together &#8211; an extensive, once private collection (over 1500 pieces) which was acquired by the museum, and that of <a href="http://mo5.com/">MO5.com</a>, an organization dedicated to &#8220;the preservation and public dissemination of digital heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exhibition is finally closing on the 13th of March, so hopefully the photos after the break can give a sense of what it was like to be there.  </p>

<p>The Museogames exhibition was a strange contrast to the rest of the museum, which showcased the development of craft and science throughout the last several hundred years. Since my generation has grown up with games since the beginning, Museogames presented what was quite literally a walk down memory lane as I encountered products that I still own and remember countless details about &#8211; whether it was the state of the game business at the time, developer culture, the technological advances being made, gameplay innovation, commercialism, and so on. For me, this made visiting the exhibition a bit more about triggering nostalgia and reflection than anything else.</p>
<p>Despite all the nostalgia, there are some bits that I am glad to leave in the past, such as Sega&#8217;s holographic/FMV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Traveler_(video_game)">Time Traveler arcade game</a>, thankfully held outside the main room. Immediate recognition and amusement quickly gave way to the realization that it was much harder on the eyes than I remembered.</p>
<p>What I do wonder about however, is how the younger (and older) generations are able to approach an exhibit like this. Are post-2000 kids, who have been around as long as Halo, curious about how we got there &#8211; or do they get bored? Can my parents&#8217; or grandparents&#8217; generation appreciate the cultural and technological relevance of the medium in a new light?</p>

<p>Metagame is a large scale social real-world game in which, being appropriately named, the purpose is to debate game aesthetics. Perfect for us opinionated geeks at the Game Developers Conference!</p>
<p>When starting the game, players receive small decks of cards consisting of four iconic games and two topics for debate, such as which game created a bigger subculture, which is more dreamlike, which gets better over time, which is a better simulation of its subject, and so on.</p>
<p>Players challenge one another by displaying a debate topic card and game card to a potential opponent, who in turn responds with a game card of his/her own. The debate begins &#8211; &#8220;No, Katamari Damacy is more culturally sophisticated than Grim Fandango, because&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; as each player takes a turn. Finally, passerby acting as judges name the better debater the winner, who receives a random card from their opponent&#8217;s deck.  Obviously, you want to win as many cards as possible &#8211; and randomly marked &#8220;star&#8221; cards serve as the final metric for scoring who will win the game in the end.</p>
<p>The game has a bit of a history but its implementation this time around struck me as a particularly nice concept and execution, despite some reservations.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t nearly as struck by Backchatter, another Local No. 12 real-world game, despite it also being very well designed &#8211; and I realized the immediate difference was in the actual physical media that Metagame utilizes. Playing with and collecting cards is a game context and vocabulary that anyone who&#8217;s ever played &#8220;Go Fish&#8221; is familiar with, and amassing an enormous deck taps into the same instincts that drive collectors of all kinds. It also helps that the cards are very nicely designed and tap into the nostalgia we have for the featured products on the front. </p>
<p>The balance of quantity was also picture-perfect &#8211; any more than six cards to start would likely have felt like too much to start off with, and any less may not trigger that collection instinct.</p>
<p>The strategies to encourage participation were also elegant and simple &#8211; bring a new player to pick up a deck, and you get another card.</p>
<p>Having a subjective set of opinions decide the final victor of any debate struck me as somewhat un-gamelike, but it really just makes the potential randomness of your judges and other social factors a part of the game itself.</p>
<p>One game-breaking flaw could be players setting up situations in which undercover allies judge their debates favorably. There are certainly ways that a game that relies on the honor system could be improved &#8211; maybe by integrating the assumption of potential cheaters into the mechanics themselves &#8211; a game layer involving the judges, penalties, or other possibilities.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see some additional guidelines for judging, if just to make for more consistent experiences. A minimum number of judges? A game incentive for judging other game sessions? </p>
<p>Finally I would like to see the introduction of a more objective element to mix in with the highly subjective mechanic of debate followed by decision. Perhaps a form of trump card? Sacrificing a second card to add a new game to the debate? A surprise in some way that didn&#8217;t rely entirely on subjectivity, while not sacrificing it entirely as the primary game element, would have really made things even more interesting than they already were.</p>

<h1>Design Notes:</h1>
<p></font></p>
<p><strong>Debate in and of itself is not a game mechanic &#8211; but it is an element that be worked into larger systems fairly well.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate the impact of well-designed physical media accompanying a non-digital game.</p>
<p>Try to mix in some element of objectivity in an otherwise subjectively determined game, or include additional rules to minimize inappropriate outcomes.</p>
<p>Game people, at least, love games about games.</strong></p>
