			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had a full plate lately, and it&#8217;s shown in the scarcity of updates for this blog. I&#8217;m currently reading submissions, working on a site redesign and preparing our first anthology over at Speech Bubble Magazine. I&#8217;ve also been focusing a bit more effort on my fiction again, in hopes of returning to this blog with fresh new fiction content &#8211; mainly my planned web serial &#8211; <em>The Penny Pincher</em>. But  my real focus lately is on my freelance services available through Totencreative, where I&#8217;m now offering a new service for self-publishing writers.</p>
<p><span id="more-926"></span>If you&#8217;re a writer planning to self-publish your book as an e-book, then the new services I&#8217;m offering at Totencreative on a freelance basis are meant for you. Before you release your book as an e-book, it needs to be properly formatted to display correctly on the device its intended for. While I can format your book for whatever platform you intend to release for, the service I&#8217;m most excited about is the <a title="E-Book Formatting Services at TotenCreative" href="http://totencreative.com/e-book-formatting-services/">formatting service</a> directed toward writers with the intention of releasing through Smashwords.</p>
<p><a title="Smashwords" href="http://www.smashwords.com">Smashwords</a> is a great way to publish your book as an e-book and reach readers. To reach the most readers, you really want your book to qualify for the Smashwords Premium Distribution, which is the list Smashwords distributes to major retailers. Before this can happen, your book needs to be formatted to their style guide so it will be properly processed by their special &#8220;Meatgrinder&#8221; software. It then needs to pass the Smashwords AutoVetter, which checks your book automatically to make sure it meets certain requirements. The book then needs to pass a hands-on inspection.</p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-style-1 su-pullquote-align-left">For $24.99, I format your book and guarantee it will pass the AutoVetter.</div>
<p>With a style-guide reaching almost 24,000 words, this could easily be intimidating to someone like you, wanting to release an e-book, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. For $24.99, I will format your book for you, and guarantee it will pass the AutoVetter. If it doesn&#8217;t pass, just send it back and I will fix it. This is an affordable way to make sure your book gains inclusion to the premium distribution catalog as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>For only $24.99, you get:</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-check">
<ul>
<li>24 hour turn around from receipt of payment</li>
<li>Smashwords-ready file</li>
<li>Linked table-of-contents, if appropriate</li>
<li>100% guarantee the file will pass the AutoVetter</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In addition to formatting services for e-book authors, I also design book covers. <a title="Contact Me At Totencreative" href="http://totencreative.com/contact-me/">Contact me through Totencreative</a> today, or email me directly at authoreit (at) gmail.com.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I sat down to write something other than a book, short story or a freelance piece. It&#8217;s also been a while since I&#8217;ve sat at a computer to do something for myself. That&#8217;s not the sign of a disinterested man; it&#8217;s the sign of a busy freelancer.</p>
<p>The past couple of weeks have been busy ones for me, that&#8217;s for sure. A couple jobs done, an ebook released and so much more &#8211; my life has turned into a constant revolving door, but I never step out of it. I just keep revolving.</p>
<p><span id="more-920"></span></p>
<p>So what&#8217;s been keeping me busy? Plenty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a website, logo and various book covers for Chronovators Press, to get that site up and running. It&#8217;s been tons of fun, but a good bit of work too.</p>
<div id="attachment_921" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-921" title="chronovatorspress" src="http://elijahtoten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/chronovatorspress-300x175.png" alt="Chronovators" width="300" height="175" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Chronovators Press Screenshot</p>
</div>
<div id="attachment_922" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-922" title="chronovatorslarge (1)" src="http://elijahtoten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/chronovatorslarge-1-300x85.png" alt="Chronovators Logo" width="300" height="85" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Chronovators Logo</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to the Chronovators press, I&#8217;ve been working with author Kaycee M. Jett (the pseudonym of someone I know very well) to design a new book cover for her book, <em>The Ordinary Housewife.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_923" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 197px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-923 " title="ordinaryhousewife" src="http://elijahtoten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ordinaryhousewife-187x300.jpg" alt="The Ordinary Housewife by Kaycee M. Jett" width="187" height="300" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">The Ordinary Housewife</p>
</div>
<p>Now, when Kaycee saw this cover attached to the email I sent her, I can only guess that she was amazed and said something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>That Elijah fellow is amazing. This book cover is exactly what I pictured in my head when I asked him to design it, and here it is. Plus, he has a great head of hair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen to that. I do have a great head of hair. The next step in this project is to format her book and prep it for release through Smashwords.com.</p>
<p>On to me, and this blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently writing several short stories, along with several installments of the upcoming serial, <em>The Pennypincher</em>. I&#8217;m hoping to release the first installment around the first of September, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Between the visits from an old farmer that claims to be the Grim Reaper, the talking corpse of a recently-deceased mouse, persisting thoughts of a girl named Danielle and local law enforcement checking in on Edgar and his mother, the quiet little farmhouse he&#8217;s grown accustomed to is crumbling around him.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that the <a title="A Man Called Edgar Snatch" href="http://elijahtoten.com/2010/05/man-called-edgar-snatch/">Edgar Snatch serial</a> is complete, I&#8217;ve started work on my next serial. Previously on my blog, I&#8217;d announced a few ideas, but things change and the idea I am working on now is based on an old story written for the FridayFlash hashtag on Twitter.</p>
<p><span id="more-900"></span></p>
<p>My next serial is entitled <em>The Pennypinchers</em> and is based on my #FridayFlash story, <em><a title="The Penny Pincher" href="http://eit.posterous.com/the-penny-pinchers-fridayflash">The Penny Pincher</a></em>.</p>
<p>Go give the story a read and get ready for a serial about a group of government employees dedicated to cutting costs, regardless of the method.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hammer breathed in Snatch&#8217;s grip; it swayed back and forth and threatened to drop down onto Laura&#8217;s head at any second. The bright flashlight beam stayed focused on Snatch&#8217;s face, and the officer holding that flashlight continued barking orders.</p>
<p>His words could have been in a different language.</p>
<p>Snatch didn&#8217;t hear them.</p>
<p>He focused on Laura.<br />
<span id="more-897"></span><br />
Sweat pooled on his face and dripped from his low brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not Mother,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>His headache asserted itself through his clouded state and crashed behind his eardrums. His brain felt as if it were in a spin cycle in the one unbalanced machine every laundromat in the world has. He vomited into his mouth and held it there.</p>
<p>The spice burned the inside of his mouth and made his teeth feel gritty, dirty, dry and wet at the same time. He blinked and tried to swallow the upchuck back down, where it belonged. His throat didn&#8217;t cooperate.</p>
<p>His throat clamped shut, firmly shook its head and told him no. He coughed and gagged at the same time.</p>
<p>The spicy mouthful of food and stomach acid spurted past his lips and up into his nose. His face felt like a fireball ripped through his nasal and sinus cavities.</p>
<p>He slung the hammer aside and held his huge hands above his head.</p>
<p>Sweat stung his eyes as he turned to look into the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hammer is down,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>The officer barked another order, but its contents didn&#8217;t matter to Snatch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now leave me the fuck alone,&#8221; Snatch said.</p>
<p>Other officers emerged from the shadows surrounding them in the forest, and Snatch finally became aware he was surrounded. Cops stood everywhere and more stepped to the meeting place in the forest with each second.</p>
<p>He counted them.</p>
<p>Ten.</p>
<p>Twelve.</p>
<p>Fifteen.</p>
<p>Standing all around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just leave me alone,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All the officers had their weapons drawn, pistols at the ready, but Snatch knew not a single one could actually pull the trigger. In their eager search, their hunt for this animal they now had surrounded, they&#8217;d created a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Any flying bullet could easily strike an officer on the other side of the circle around Snatch.</p>
<p>Snatch saw this.</p>
<p>Through his headache and nausea, he saw this.</p>
<p>He stepped closer to the first officer, the one with the flashlight, quivering but still blinding.</p>
<p>The officer threatened to shoot.</p>
<p>Snatch barrelled into him and took him to the ground. He pushed up and tried to rush into the woods, but dizziness overtook him. He swayed in place, on one knee over the downed officer, and fell back, flat against the earth. He stared up into the treetops, past the canopy, into the black night sky.</p>
<p>The police officers weren&#8217;t afflicted in the same way he was. They didn&#8217;t struggle to overcome dizziness, confusion, headaches and voices. They didn&#8217;t flash in and out of reality. They weren&#8217;t focused on getting away no matter what. They didn&#8217;t want to just be left to themselves.</p>
<p>They were on him.</p>
<p>Like the animals they claimed him to be.</p>
<p>Snatch felt the first kick from one of the officers. A blow to the shoulder, that scraped up past his shoulder and chest and skidded over onto his neck.</p>
<p>The next one landed cleanly against his side.</p>
<p>Pain slammed through his nerves and crashed through his body up to his brain. The pain met with his headache and had coffee. After coffee, the pain took his headache into an alley and raped it. His headache had a baby.</p>
<p>A tearing, ripping pain born of the symphony of pain in his body slammed into him and asserted itself.</p>
<p>Snatch clamped his eyes shut and screamed out into the night.</p>
<p>The leaves in the forest shook and trembled.</p>
<p>The officers were the animals now and they fed off of of one another. Kick after kick landed on Snatch as they continued their flurried assault. Laura screamed for them to stop. <em>Just put cuffs on him</em>, she said, <em>and it will all be over. He needs help.</em></p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t stop.</p>
<p>A kick bounced like a baby on concrete off of Snatch&#8217;s temple.</p>
<p>Pain punched around in Snatch&#8217;s head. The night seemed to swallow him. He couldn&#8217;t catch his breath.</p>
<p>Through the pain, a voice reached through. A moment of nothingness cut his pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Edgar,&#8221; the Reaper said, &#8220;look at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snatch turned his head and opened one eye to look past the legs kicking him. The legs seemed to move in slow motion, but he moved normally, and so did the rest of the world. Things distorted.</p>
<p>The sun shined in his eyes, but the night choked out the sun.</p>
<p>He blinked and focused on the Reaper, where the old farmer sat crouched just outside the circle of officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not real,&#8221; Snatch said. Blood dripped down into his open eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really want to debate this right now?&#8221; the Reaper questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I ever told you how easy it is to break an ankle?&#8221; the Reaper asked. He motioned around Snatch, to all of the legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t win,&#8221; Snatch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the Reaper said, &#8220;but you can survive. You just need to fight back enough to break them out of this rage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just like Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Reaper nodded. &#8220;Everyone has a little rage in them. Some people, like you, just have a different way of responding to it. Fight back right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snatch turned his head to look up at the night sky and felt his pain begin a slow return. Reality fought against the distortion his mind brought, and struggled to drag him back down to the dirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a long, happy future together,&#8221; the Reaper said with a smile.</p>
<p>The headache returned. The pain returned. Blood dripped down Snatch&#8217;s brow and into his eyes. Still, he managed to reach and and grip one of the legs. Which one, he didn&#8217;t know, but one of the legs sat firmly in his grip.</p>
<p>He squeezed the leg in his grip and brought his other fist down, right on the ankle, where the foot met the leg. He felt his fist crush bone like a hammer.</p>
<p>Snatch heard a scream of pain, and this time it wasn&#8217;t his.</p>
<p>He grabbed another foot and twisted it in his grip. He felt the leg break or dislocate at the knee. He shoved the leg away.</p>
<p>Another scream of pain cut the night open.</p>
<p>Not his.</p>
<p>Hands reached down into the mix of legs. Another set of hands, and then another.</p>
<p>The officers rolled Snatch over, face down into the dirt and cuffed his hands behind him.</p>
<p>They dragged him to his feet.</p>
<p>Snatch swayed and would have fallen if a couple officers didn&#8217;t hold him up. He closed his eyes and tried to shut out the pain as they dragged him from the wonderful woods.</p>
<p>He stumbled along with the few officers that pulled him out of the woods and across the dead field dotted with hay bales.</p>
<p>The farmhouse blazed like a torch . Fire danced and fought with the darkness of the sky.</p>
<p>Snatch&#8217;s head cracked against the patrol car as police shoved him into the back seat of one of the many squad cars in the farmhouse driveway. He stared at the fire and for a moment, he saw a silhouette writhing in the fire.</p>
<p>Mother&#8217;s silhouette, a giant, flabby shape, struggled against the walls of flame around her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it hurts,&#8221; Snatch murmured.</p>
<p>He leaned his head back and let blood drip from his teeth into the back of his throat. An officer leaned down and tapped the window to get Snatch&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, retard,&#8221; the officer said. &#8220;You&#8217;re going away for a long, long time, buddy. What kind of stupid name is Snatch, anyway?&#8221; The officer walked away and left the taunt hanging.</p>
<p>Snatch turned away and realized he wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>
<p>Next to him in the rear of the squad car, the Reaper sat calmly, with the seat belt buckled and his hands folded in his lap. Next to the Reaper, the dead Mouse sat, also buckled up and ready to go. They both turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Snatch laughed.</p>
<p>The sound grated on his own ears as the realization hit him. The officers couldn&#8217;t touch him. The real world couldn&#8217;t touch him. Mother couldn&#8217;t touch him.</p>
<p>Snatch&#8217;s laugh filled the car and blocked everything else out as he stared at the Reaper and the dead Mouse.</p>
<p>Nothing could touch him.</p>
<p>Snatch cut his laugh short and opened his mouth. His voice cracked and dragged itself past his bloody tongue, teeth and lips. His words carried the same sound as a bag of gravel grinding in slow-motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;All a sad boy needs is a friend and a pet.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tree line loomed ahead as Snatch stumbled forward, on his way to the wonderful woods. The trees called to him as he felt the heat of the flaming farmhouse behind him. The flickering fire danced and threw wicked shadows against the dark tree line, shapes that Snatch thought he could see the Reaper and the dead mouse in.</p>
<p>Snatch&#8217;s senses stumbled less than he did. He could hear the sound of gravel crunching as more squad cars pulled into the farmhouse&#8217;s driveway and smell the sweat beading on each officer&#8217;s forehead. He saw the shadows swirling against the tree line as he stumbled toward the thin first line of trees.<br />
<span id="more-890"></span><br />
Snatch reached the tree line.</p>
<p>He turned and looked back toward the farmhouse engulfed in flames. The fire cracked and popped and the roof caved in.</p>
<p>The farmhouse exploded with a burst of flames as fire ate through to the propane, and steam billowed out from the fire as the old water heater&#8217;s safety valve overheated and opened up to let excess pressure out.</p>
<p>He looked past the flames, to the sea of blinking red and blues, the ocean of Crown Victorias in the farmhouse driveway. In reality, there were only six or seven squad cars, but Snatch saw hundreds, thousands, and every police officer there was ready to kill him.</p>
<p>He turned away from the officers and the lights and the fire and stumbled deeper into the woods. He heard the clicks and snaps as every officer unclipped the clasps on their guns.</p>
<p>Why couldn&#8217;t they just leave him alone?</p>
<p>He heard Laura deeper in the trees, somewhere in the frightening forest.</p>
<p>He realized the woods worried him when he stood in them, within the shadows thrown down to the dead dirt. Outside of the woods, he found them wonderful, welcoming, wanting. Inside, they were frightening. They scared him.</p>
<p>He searched around in the weeds growing around the thin trunks of scattered thin trees. He knew as he stumbled forward, he would find Laura somewhere, handcuffed to a tree where he&#8217;d left her.</p>
<p>And next to her, he&#8217;d find his sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Behind him, he heard the crashing of officers as they moved into the woods to look for him. Shouts and calls for him to stop did nothing to him. He moved on, through the trees, knowing he moved faster than them, even through his headache, and dizziness, and the stumbling and confusion.</p>
<p>These were his woods, his trees, his forest. This is where it all started for him. This is where he would go when Mother got drunk and kicked him out. He would spend the night among the trees, crying as he grew older and less loved.</p>
<p>Blood rushed behind his eardrums.</p>
<p>His heart pounded in his chest.</p>
<p>Sweat pooled in the folds at the back of his head and rolled down his neck and back. His greasy hair smelled so bad that his nostrils picked up the scent of it even past the scent of his sweat-fueled body odor.</p>
<p>He stopped and stood near a larger tree. He turned and surveyed the forest behind him. Officers were fanning out into the woods to cover more area.</p>
<p>They were hunting him.</p>
<p>Like an animal.</p>
<p>He pulled a slow, heavy breath through the thick Louisiana air. His senses fell into place and started to cooperate with him again. He fought his headache into submission and cleared his head.</p>
<p>To his right, an officer stalked through the woods. A young officer, frightened, sweating, gun trembling. He stood next to the tree where Snatch stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not an animal,&#8221; Snatch whispered.</p>
<p>He stepped around the tree and gripped the officer&#8217;s gun by the barrel and jerked it from the man&#8217;s grasp. In the same, fumbling motion he flung himself against the officer and sent him to the ground.</p>
<p>Snatch straddled the man and looked down at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you leave me alone?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>He glanced up from the downed officer and looked around. He saw flickering flashlights in the woods, but none too close.</p>
<p>He looked back down to the officer. The man struggled under Snatch&#8217;s weight and opened his mouth to call for help.</p>
<p>Snatch looked down at the gun, held by the barrel, in his hand. He slammed it cleanly against the officer&#8217;s forehead before he could make a sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not an animal,&#8221; Snatch said.</p>
<p>He stood up and dropped the gun.</p>
<p>His headache returned with force and ran down into his neck and shoulders. Sweat dripped from the tip of his nose. He burned up beneath his coveralls. He burned as if he stood at Hell&#8217;s gates.</p>
<p>He turned and swayed as the world moved under him and he looked up at the trees as they towered over him and taunted him. He licked his teeth, tasting the stale skin of plaque that covered them.</p>
<p>He needed to find Laura. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. He needed to do at least one thing right.</p>
<p>He could release Laura and show the hunters on his tail that he wasn&#8217;t the creature they thought they hunted.</p>
<p>He stumbled away from the downed officer and searched the trees for something identifiable, something he could gauge his location with. A vine, a strange mark on tree bark, anything he could use to help locate Laura.</p>
<p>As he searched, a random pass of a distant flashlight glinted off of something near the base of a tree in the distance. He rushed through the trees, toward the glint. He knew immediately what that little flash of light in the darkness was.</p>
<p>Handcuffs.</p>
<p>He approached the tree and slowed his gait. He sucked a breath into his chest and calmly approached the tree.</p>
<p>Laura was on the ground, arms still wrapped around the tree, with strips of blood on her wrists. He took a step closer to her and she turned to face him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura,&#8221; Snatch said. His hoarse, deep voice crawled past his tongue like a sack of rocks grinding together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never should have gotten involved with you,&#8221; Laura said past her tears and trembling voice. &#8220;I should have gone with my instincts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Snatch said. He held up his hands to show they were empty. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to let you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop playing with me, Edgar. Just turn yourself in. I can hear the sirens. It sounds like the whole station is here. You&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Snatch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Laura whispered. &#8220;I never should have gotten involved with you. Your last name is Snatch, for Christ&#8217;s sake. Snatch! What kind of name is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snatch took a step back and clenched his teeth.</p>
<p><em>Dirty, stinking Snatch</em>, he heard Mother say. <em>Dirty, stinking Snatch</em>.</p>
<p>His headache broke past his mindframe and blood rushed back into his head. A wave of heat rolled over his neck and head. He took a step back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going down,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;Just give it up, Snatch.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Snatch. You smell like one.</em> Snatch heard Mother&#8217;s words again.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Snatch said. He looked past Laura and spotted his sledgehammer on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Laura asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snatch stepped over Laura and leaned down to wrap both hands around his sledgehammer. Mother&#8217;s words ran through his head and he looked over at Laura as he lifted the sledgehammer above his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it. Things will only get worse for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He readied the sledgehammer and tensed his arms. He stared down at Laura and his lips twitched. Sweat rolled down his arms, into his armpits, and from his armpits, down his sides, to his waist. His coveralls were soaked through.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill you, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Edgar, no! I&#8217;m not your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never loved me, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stretched his body out and stepped one foot back to brace himself. He swung the sledgehammer high.</p>
<p>A bright flash of light momentarily blinded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop the hammer!&#8221; the voice behind the light shouted.</p>
<p>Snatch looked into the light and could barely make out the shape of an officer, gun drawn and ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop the hammer! I&#8217;ll put you down, I swear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snatch looked down at Laura and his lips twitched and curled down into a sneer. The sledgehammer seemed to glow in the light.</p>
<p>The hammer felt so heavy in his calloused hands.</p>
<p>It wanted to crush Laura&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I killed Mother. </em></p>
<p>Snatch&#8217;s words ran through his head as he spoke them. They seemed unreal, twisted, warped, surreal. He gagged and fought back the rush of acid up his throat. His tongue convulsed in his mouth.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, turning to look at the Reaper in his old farmer guise. “It&#8217;s not possible.”<br />
<span id="more-886"></span><br />
The Reaper nodded. “Yes. It is possible.”</p>
<p>Snatch shook his head.</p>
<p>The Reaper stepped forward and pulled the piece of straw from between his dry, cracked lips. “Yes,” he said. He tossed the hay straw aside and unfastened the straps of his overalls.  He grinned and showed his yellow teeth.</p>
<p>As the Reaper dropped his overalls and stepped out of them, his body shape changed. He reached up to his face and peeled the skin back like a mask, starting at the chin and pulling up toward the top of his head. Underneath, it wasn&#8217;t bone, no skull. More skin.</p>
<p>Snatch stared in disbelief as the Reaper shed his clothing and skin.</p>
<p>The Reaper stripped his skin and clothing away, until Snatch realized he was staring at himself. Under all of the ripping skin and falling clothing, the Reaper looked exactly like him. Snatch squeezed his eyes closed and shook his head.</p>
<p>His headache returned with a nauseating force.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The Reaper was gone, no longer standing in front of him. He pulled a breath through the thick hair hanging in the farmhouse and almost choked. The realization pooled behind his eyes. His bottom lip quivered and he licked each tooth, one at a time.</p>
<p>The Reaper was a figment of his imagination. The Reaper wasn&#8217;t real. He turned to look back at the decayed carcass under his floorboards.</p>
<p>Danielle.</p>
<p>Mother.</p>
<p>He stood and clenched his teeth. His hands trembled out in front of him as he tried to keep his body from swaying. He stood there in his room, swaying from side to side like a man on a tightwire, a tightrope act gone terribly awry. The balance required to keep his footing was just beyond his grasp.</p>
<p>His life fell apart around him.</p>
<p>He could feel his world crumbling like a broken tower of bricks and he fell. His body slammed against the wall and he squeezed his eyes closed to chase away the sound of rushing blood behind his eardrums.</p>
<p>His heart slammed in his chest and his stomach flipped and flopped like a toddler on a roller-coaster. He turned and saw the mouse, the dead mouse, on the floor.</p>
<p>It looked up at him with a dead grin.</p>
<p>“How&#8217;s it feel, Snatch?”</p>
<p>“What?” Snatch asked. He gripped his ears until his unclipped fingernails dug into the skin of his head and sent small lines of blood trickling down his flesh.</p>
<p>“How&#8217;s it feel to finally realize that it&#8217;s you? It&#8217;s all you. It&#8217;s always been you.” The mouse grinned, a yellow and decayed smile.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re not real,” Snatch uttered.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re right,” the mouse answered. “I&#8217;m in your head, and yet, here I am. On the floor talking to you. I&#8217;m a dead mouse! This is ridiculous!”</p>
<p>Snatch squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head from side to side with such force that his neck popped with each swing. He opened his eyes and the mouse was gone.</p>
<p>His headache rolled away into the recesses of his brain and the blood stopped rushing so loudly behind his eardrums. His world started to shift and become clear.</p>
<p>Under his floorboards he saw the truth. A dead woman. No strange gray hide textured like an elephant. Just the disgusting remnants of a corpse long dead.</p>
<p>It rolled back to him, in bits, in pieces.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d killed Mother some time ago, just to have some peace.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d gotten rid of the source of so much trauma in his life.</p>
<p>So he could live alone on his farm, alone with his thoughts, for what he&#8217;d hoped would be the rest of his life. Now, starting with the Sheriff, putting his nose where it didn&#8217;t belong, outsiders had started to pour in.</p>
<p>They just couldn&#8217;t let him live in peace.</p>
<p>Mother, the bitch, even dead, couldn&#8217;t let him live in peace. His mind would never let him live in peace.</p>
<p>In his few short moments of clarity, he realized his situation.</p>
<p>A police officer handcuffed to a tree in the forest. The entire station knew where she was. Other officers were likely on their way to the farmhouse now. They wouldn&#8217;t find the Sheriff&#8217;s body here, but they would find Mother.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“That won&#8217;t happen,” he muttered.</p>
<p>His headache returned with the sound of triumphant trumpets in his ears. Like an elephant stomping his brain, pain rushed down his neck and into his spine.</p>
<p>He turned and headed out through the living room and into the kitchen. He snatched drawers out from their tracks and slung the doors to the cabinets open.</p>
<p>Matches.</p>
<p>He gripped the tiny box in his large, calloused hand and stumbled outside into the darkening day. He licked his teeth and searched the yard.</p>
<p>He walked around back and spotted what he was looking for.</p>
<p>Gasoline.</p>
<p>The large red container with the yellow nozzle stood as a stark opposite to the dead gray color of the lifeless grass. Snatch stumbled over to it and gripped the handle.</p>
<p>He shook the container side to side and heard the gasoline slosh against the sides of the weathered container.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s enough,” he said. He unscrewed the nozzle and started splashing the farmhouse.</p>
<p>The ground fought against him and the world lurched from side to side in its half-hearted attempt at keeping him from completing his task, but it only took minutes, even through the confusion, the pounding of his heart, the panic rising in his throat, the sledgehammer of a headache against his temples and the roaring river of blood splashing its way behind his eyes and eardrums. He took several steps back from the house, carrying the gas can with him.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Mother.”</p>
<p>Snatch struck a single match against the outside of the box, and dropped it into the open mouth of the gasoline can. Blue and orange flames licked around the mouth of the can, and Snatch slung it into the open door of the farmhouse.</p>
<p>He waited.</p>
<p>His heart pounded.</p>
<p>His breath caught in his throat and he swayed, almost fell, in place.</p>
<p>Any moment now.</p>
<p>The flames caught the gas fumes surrounding the house and roared to sudden life. Red and orange flames danced around the farmhouse. In the shapes of the flames as they grew higher, Snatch saw things.</p>
<p>He really saw them, he was sure. They weren&#8217;t in his head.</p>
<p>Burning down with his farmhouse, was the Reaper.</p>
<p>The dead Mouse.</p>
<p>And Danielle.</p>
<p>Mother.</p>
<p>He pulled his eyes away from the mesmerizing fire and saw lights flickering through the dancing flames. Red and blue. Several of them.</p>
<p>He recognized the appearance of the police lights.</p>
<p>“Come and get me,” he whispered.</p>
<p>He turned and stumbled toward the treeline.</p>
