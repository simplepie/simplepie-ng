			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m on the road but I haven&#8217;t missed a Carnival of Journalism deadline since I helped re-start it last November and I don&#8217;t intend to start now.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s topic from <em><a href="http://andrewpergam.wordpress.com/">Andrew Pergam</a></em> is the <a href="http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/09/08/carnival-of-journalism-online-video/">future of online video</a>. This is no easy topic to tackle. While I greatly believe in multimedia storytelling and that video will very much be a part of the web, it isn&#8217;t a topic I zen out on regularly.</p>
<p>But there are a few things I think we can expect more of. They might not feel very &#8220;journalism-y&#8221; but let&#8217;s talk about the medium, not the content.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2011/09/thoughts-on-the-future-of-video-jcarn/video_icon_full" rel="attachment wp-att-3566"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3566" title="video_icon_full" src="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/video_icon_full.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>1. Easy, fun creation: I love <a href="http://www.xtranormal.com/">Xtranormal</a> and other story-boarding technology. One of the most popular is, funny enough, a Japanese company which takes news of the week <a href="http://www.videobash.com/video_show/japanese-news-animates-bin-laden-story-22138">and animates it</a>. As this technology gets easier I expect to see the LOL cats version of story boarding.</p>
<p>2. Hangouts/Skype and group video will mean the death of the talk show. When the Internet and television collide, which will inevitably happen, the talking head show as we know it will be displaced. A site like <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/">BloggingHeads.tv</a> will be viewed as way ahead of its time.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/12/coming-soon-to-journalism-matt-thompson-sees-the-speakularity-and-universal-instant-transcription/">The Speakularity</a>. Matt Thompson coined this phrase. Interestingly enough his post came out just as a friend (and former reporter) was co-founding <a href="http://speakertext.com/">SpeakerText</a>. One day videos will be searchable the way the rest of the web is. Think about the amount of information that could be unearthed. We will be able to link to quotes within a video.</p>
<p>These are just three things which I expect to see more of in the future.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve said this many times before: the driving force behind my career has been to increase the level of transparency and participation in the process of journalism.</p>
<p>That driving force has taken my career in all kinds of fun and exciting directions and today I&#8217;d like to announce a new one.</p>
<p>This year I&#8217;ll be working with UC Berkeley&#8217;s journalism school. Specifically I will be working with the schools&#8217; three hyperlocal sites (<a href="http://missionlocal.org/">MissionLocal.org</a>, <a href="http://oaklandnorth.net/">OaklandNorth.net</a> and <a href="http://richmondconfidential.org/">RichmondConfidential.com</a>) to come up with new products for their website. Some of these products might be editorial or service related &#8211; but the main thrust will be to experiment with new business products.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2011/09/hyperlocal-heaven-at-uc-berkeleys-j-school/go-bears" rel="attachment wp-att-3460"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3460" title="go bears" src="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/go-bears.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Before <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/haters-gonna-hate#.Tk2uCDvOWok">haters</a> eagerly call <a href="http://spot.us">Spot.Us</a> a failure let me type this reassuring paragraph and get back to the lede. Spot.Us has enough money in the bank to give us a runway of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least</span></em> one year &#8211; possibly more (<strong>August was our first break-even month!</strong>). That includes salary for myself and our C.T.O. Erik Sundelof in addition to any money we would raise for reporters. In fact, Spot.Us is in PERFECT position to scale up and that&#8217;s exactly what we are working on. I will remain an active part of Spot.Us and in the coming weeks we should have some exciting news which will cement it as an ongoing business (elevated from a mere experiment) for at least another two years. So Spot.Us is doing business as usual right now and soon might be doing even more of it!</p>
<p><strong>But back to the point</strong>: As an entrepreneur and somebody who likes to push boundaries (see first sentence) I felt like it was time to get my hands dirty with something new. There were certain experiments I couldn&#8217;t try with Spot.Us which, rightfully so, cornered itself into the non-advertising, nonprofit world. Some of these experiments are ambitious, some are quick and light, others are yet to be thought of &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure will be fun.</p>
<p>The hyperlocal sites at Berkeley already have a lot of traction. In fact, they don&#8217;t get enough credit for what they&#8217;ve accomplished. These are real world sites run by students but they&#8217;ve become integral to their communities. I am eager to jump into their fertile ground for product experiments that could educate both the individuals involved (students and myself) and the larger journalism industry. <strong>As always you can expect to learn about our success and failures on this blog and <a href="http://localreport.org">The Local Report</a>, a blog set up to capture lessons from Berkeley&#8217;s hyperlocal sites.</strong></p>
<p>I am also excited about the opportunity to have a positive impact on the curriculum at UC Berkeley&#8217;s J-school. The program already has amazing journalism professors and the students come out as superb digital storytellers. But storytelling doesn&#8217;t exist in a vacuum. A rounded journalism education should take into account the ecosystem of the web, the know-how of participatory media (including social media) and an appreciation of entrepreneurial skills. That&#8217;s what I hope to rub off into the program.</p>
<p>Combine all this with my own sense of Cal-Alumni pride (undergraduate class of 2004) and you can see why I&#8217;m terribly excited to begin working at Berkeley. Expect to hear more about this and Spot.Us as things move forward.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with the journalism program at UC Berkeley or their hyperlocals, the video below will give a small introduction. Note that this video was from their launch in 2008. Since then the sites have continued to grow &#8211; publishing year round. Again those three sites are: <a href="http://missionlocal.org/">MissionLocal.org</a>, <a href="http://richmondconfidential.org/">RichmondConfidential.com</a> and <a href="http://oaklandnorth.net">OaklandNorth.Net</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Got ideas for Berkeley&#8217;s hyperlocal sites to try? &#8211; LET ME KNOW!</strong></span></h3>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been a lot happening in the technology/media world this week. Who could turn away from the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/08/not-leaving-quietly/">back and forth</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/the-end/">between</a> Mike Arrington at TechCrunch and Arianna Huffington, his supposed boss at AOL, with Tim Armstrong trying to save face on all sides.</p>
<p>Then seemingly out of nowhere the CEO of Yahoo is<a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-yahoo-fallout-20110909,0,5823494.story"> kicked out</a> and a &#8220;<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/yahoo_for_sale_maybe/">For Sale</a>&#8221; sign is put up on their front yard.</p>
<p>Both Yahoo! and AOL were technology giants that are moving to become media entities. AOL doesn&#8217;t hide it with the HUGE investment in Patch and acquiring HuffingtonPost. Yahoo perhaps made the shift too coy and thus might have to start breaking apart. Yahoo hasn&#8217;t made the drastic switch of resources that AOL has and the potential sale might be a direct reflection of poor internal investments. Now AOL&#8217;s big bet might not win &#8211; but at least it was a conscious bet that the company made to become a content creator of massive proportions. I think Yahoo always rested its laurels on being a search company with a few social properties here and there (they never utilized Delicious or Flickr that well).</p>
<p>And thus the lesson below&#8230;..</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2011/09/tech-companies-are-media-companies-and-vice-versa/6a00d8341c823e53ef0133f3053e5d970b-400wi" rel="attachment wp-att-3540"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3540" title="6a00d8341c823e53ef0133f3053e5d970b-400wi" src="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d8341c823e53ef0133f3053e5d970b-400wi.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Technology companies must understand that they are also media companies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media companies must understand that they are also technology companies.</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the two are married.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back to get here.</p>
<p><strong>1. All media is social</strong></p>
<p>The intent of media is to communicate something to people. Skirting the &#8220;if a tree falls in a forest&#8221; question &#8211; I&#8217;d say that all media is social.</p>
<p><strong>2. Then what the hell is social media?</strong></p>
<p>What we call &#8220;social media&#8221; is a misnomer given #1 above. A more proper understanding of it might be &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute">minute</a> media&#8221; or media about minutia (then again, &#8216;minutia&#8217; is all about perspective; &#8216;dog bites man&#8217; is big news to the man&#8217;s family). When blogs bursted on the scene in the early 2000&#8242;s we saw some of this minute media. It turns out that was just a crack in the damn. The real wave of minute media came around life-casting ie: Twitter, Facebook updates, etc. But this is all media.</p>
<p>3. Minute media is made possible by technology.</p>
<p>See: the Internet, the falling cost of publishing, etc.</p>
<p>4. If technology powers this rapidly evolving media (it defines the medium) then technology companies are media companies. That might not mean &#8220;journalism&#8221; companies &#8211; but media companies nonetheless.</p>
<p>Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Twitter and more are all technology companies that make their money because of the media they produce or enable.</p>
<p>Even Apple is a media company to some degree. They build hardware with the intent of syncing it to their very massive and user-friendly media store iTunes.</p>
<p>Some of this is not news for folks (<a href="https://plus.google.com/107277729419802402411/posts">Lisa Williams</a> may be the first person I heard to clearly state this). When I look at AOL&#8217;s and Yahoo&#8217;s moves it strikes me as apparent and something to take pause to notice. AOL, while often berated for patch, should be applauded because while most technology companies that move into media deal with &#8216;content&#8217; AOL made a specific goal to do community journalism.</p>
<p>So where does this leave media companies?</p>
<p>They must move to become more like technology companies. They must learn to either create their own platforms for minute media or truly adopt/adapt to other platforms. They must find and define the platforms that enable the type of media they want to support. This, I believe, starts where <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/09/03/but-is-it-journalism-damnit/">Jeff Jarvis&#8217; post about platforms being journalism leaves off</a>. It&#8217;s not that platforms are journalism &#8211; it&#8217;s that <strong>technology enables media and journalism is a type of media that requires a type of platform</strong>. Journalists love to complain about Demand Media, for example, but it&#8217;s a beautiful case where a media company has built a technology platform to support the type of media they want to make. I agree, it&#8217;s not journalism &#8211; but then journalists must BUILD the platform that enables their type of media or pray somebody else does. Newspapers should define that technology platform instead of waiting for somebody else to build it for them (charging them an arm and a leg in the process).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little under the weather so I&#8217;m not even going to give this a second read/edit. But hey, this is my semi-minute media space. It&#8217;ll hopefully be interesting to somebody.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this year&#8217;s ONA I&#8217;ll be on a panel &#8220;<a href="http://ona11.journalists.org/2011/08/ona11-full-schedule-released-field-trips-open/">I failed and so can you</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of failure. I think journalism should hold a &#8220;<a href="http://failcamp.org/">fail camp</a>&#8221; (inspired by <a href="http://ethanzuckerman.com/blog/">Ethan Zuckerman</a>). When I re-started the blog carnival I dedicated a <a href="http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/05/09/carnival-of-fail-jcarn-roundup-4/">month towards failure</a>. I&#8217;m working on a new project (details to come soon, promise) and I think/hope failure will be a big part of it.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about barriers to success. But we also say that we can only succeed on the shoulders of our many failures. Therefore I&#8217;d like to point out what I think are the barriers to failure (and therefore also to success). If we don&#8217;t fail early and fail often we won&#8217;t push forward. So below are some barriers to failure. Luckily most of these are easily overcome if you can identify them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2011/08/barriers-to-failure/failure01" rel="attachment wp-att-3491"><img class="aligncenter" title="failure01" src="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/failure01.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="448" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>1. It&#8217;s not a problem until it&#8217;s a problem.</strong></h2>
<p>The &#8220;What If&#8217;s&#8221; are a terrible thing. It assumes that every bad scenario you can think of needs to be handled right away before you even start. This is the opposite of the sage philosophy from &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;: <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Its_a_Problem_When_Its_a_Problem.php">It&#8217;s not a problem until it&#8217;s a problem</a>. I put this barrier first because it&#8217;s a particularly poignant problem in the journalism community. We are natural skeptics. Our instinct is to think about who might be secretly benefiting, who is maliciously stealing public money what &#8216;problem&#8217; is there underneath the surface. That&#8217;s great in reporting but the WRONG attitude to starting something new. The &#8220;What If&#8217;s&#8221; are unproductive. Deal with &#8220;this is&#8221; when it happens. I am very familiar with &#8220;what ifs&#8221; because I get them every time I explain <a href="http://spot.us">Spot.Us</a> to a journalist that has never heard of the concept.</p>

<p>What if stories get influenced by a donor?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concerned journalist</strong>: <span style="color: #ff0000;">What if</span> a neo-Nazi wants to fund a story? OH MY GOD David &#8211; HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO JOURNALISM?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: Well, we limit how much a person can donate, so you need a group of people.</li>
<li><strong>Concerned journalist</strong>: Well, <span style="color: #ff0000;">what if</span> a GROUP of neo-Nazis want to fund a story?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: umm&#8230; well, you need a reporter who puts their professional reputation on the line doing that story.</li>
<li><strong>Concerned journalist</strong>: Well, <span style="color: #ff0000;">what if</span> the reporter is a Nazi? Jesus David, didn&#8217;t you think about that!</li>
<li><strong>Answer if I have energy</strong>: If there is a group of neo-Nazis and a reporter, they don&#8217;t need my site to do the story they want to do.</li>
<li><strong>Answer to stop the obvious &#8216;<span style="color: #ff0000;">what if</span>&#8216; cycle of the conversation</strong>: You&#8217;re right. I should shut down the site before that happens.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: If the reason you aren&#8217;t doing something starts with &#8220;what if&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s a bad reason not to move forward and perhaps fail. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It&#8217;s not a problem until it&#8217;s a problem.</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2. Tradition!!!!</strong> (sung loudly while swinging your hands in the air)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2011/08/barriers-to-failure/51cbms3hwyl-_sl500_aa280_" rel="attachment wp-att-3479"><img title="51cbms3HWYL._SL500_AA280_" src="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/51cbms3HWYL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Traditions are great. But if presented with a new way to do something which breaks tradition &#8211; you should take it. Traditions are only as strong as their tests. If you never test a tradition, it&#8217;s weak, fragile and hasn&#8217;t evolved. If you test the tradition against a new method and the new method fails, score for tradition (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRdfX7ut8gw">waves hands, sings loudly</a>), but if not &#8211; you must learn to adapt. The old tradition of war was that it was fought in an open field in straight lines of volleyed musket fire wearing bright uniforms that looked like targets. That &#8220;tradition&#8221; didn&#8217;t stand the test of time for a reason. Do you really want to defend the online version of volley-musket fire because it&#8217;s &#8220;tradition.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Letting the perfect be an enemy of the good.</strong></p>
<p>Dreams of perfection should not stall the launch of something good. If it were perfect you wouldn&#8217;t fail early or often. You wouldn&#8217;t fail at all. But one could also argue if you were aiming for perfection, you&#8217;d end up attempting nothing. At a certain point you have to accept what is and isn&#8217;t possible in a reasonable timeline and aim for what is reasonable. The good news is that you don&#8217;t have to END there. You are just starting there. In some respects I think that&#8217;s the reason so many folks let perfection become the enemy of the good. They are concerned that they&#8217;ll never progress after an initial effort. Hence, we won&#8217;t start unless we know we can get all the way. This is a great way to invest months into a project that could fall flat its face. Remember: <a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2009/01/editors-and-publishers-in-a-battle-against-inertia">It&#8217;s cheaper and easier to try something than it is to debate about whether or not to try something</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fear&#8230; of failure.  </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a perfectly natural fear. Nobody wants to have their ego bruised. Luckily we are living in a time where the web is figuring itself out. There is a way to fail gracefully, to fail towards success. It&#8217;s not even altruistic, if you fail you&#8217;ll learn more and will be more likely to succeed in a future endeavor. You can fail selfishly and get kudos along the way. <a href="http://www.smokeybear.com/">Remember kids</a>, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only you can defeat fear of failure.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><strong>5. Institutional momentum</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit different from &#8220;tradition&#8221; above (#2). In this case it isn&#8217;t for lack of will that new things are tried and potentially failed. In this instance it&#8217;s for lack of an institutional way. In other words &#8211; there are no resources (time, money, knowledge), to get started on a project even though everyone earnestly wants to try it. The good news, any institution that has this problem of existing momentum also has some resource,s it&#8217;s just a matter of allocation. This is the classic newspaper problem. Why don&#8217;t news organizations stop the presses and invest in digital? Because print is still where they make their money. You can&#8217;t cut off the head to save the body.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the truth. If there is a will, there is a way. Fact is, if you accept that perfection is not the enemy of the good and that you don&#8217;t need to accommodate every &#8220;what if&#8221; scenario, you can create a streamlined alpha of many projects. You can do this independent of the institution. And institutions need to learn to let go, allow some <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/googles-20-percent-time-in-action.html">20% time</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works">skunkworks</a> or whatever you want to call it. You just need a wee-little bit of space. The smudgiest of resources to begin. From there &#8211; you&#8217;ll get a better sense of whether or not something is worth more resources.</p>
<p><strong>6. Resources to get started</strong></p>
<p>There is good, fast and cheap. <a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2009/10/lessons-in-web-development-good-fast-and-cheap-pick-two">You get to pick two</a>.  Keep your <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Fix_Time_and_Budget_Flex_Scope.php">scope small and remain flexible</a>. Google does have a lot of resources and yet innovation happens outside of their Google-plex. It&#8217;s possible. You just have to be ready to make sacrifices. The good news is that you can always come back to fix things. Later will always happen &#8211; now is fleeting. Take advantage of now so that in the future, you can continue to push forward.</p>
<p><strong>7. Leadership vacuum</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have good leadership you won&#8217;t launch new products. Leadership needs to be clear, so that everyone can get in line. Leadership needs to have a vision, to communicate that vision and know how to navigate the above barriers. If not, they themselves are a barrier. In truth, leadership is a post in and of itself, but certainly a leadership vacuum is a great barrier to failure. While that last sentence may seem counter-intuitive (great leadership should lead to success) consider <strong>Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s quote</strong>: &#8220;In any moment of decision, the <em>best thing</em> you can <em>do</em> is the right <em>thing</em>, the next <em>best thing</em> is the wrong <em>thing</em>, and the worst <em>thing</em> you can <em>do is nothing.&#8221;</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The medium is the message.&#8221; This is a saying to convey an idea that &#8220;the medium influences how the message is perceived.&#8221; At least, that&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">according to Wikipedia</a>.  Ironically that this &#8220;comes&#8221; from Wikipedia&#8230;.means something.</p>
<p>In our ongoing group of surveys on the media supported by the <a href="http://www.thewhitmaninstitute.org/">Whitman Institut</a>e  we are looking at how media plays a role in our decision making. How we converse with each other, ourselves our national body politic and beyond through the media. <a href="http://spot.us/cca/23-the-spread-of-breaking-news">You can take the latest Whitman Institute survey on Spot.Us</a>. Not only will you inform our query about breaking news, you&#8217;ll earn $5 that can be applied to the news story of your choice. Hooray!</p>
<p>In this survey we asked you if and how the media has had an influence on the world. During the Obama campaign in 2008 there was a lot of discussion that the media played an influential role, swooning over Obama and attacking Sarah Palin. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 others believed the media played an influential role by ignoring tell-tale signs. That somehow the media was asleep at the wheel and this influenced the financial downturn.</p>
<p>Journalists often say that you cannot have a democracy without a healthy and independent media. That at its best good journalism can directly influence policy, voting decisions and more. There is a notion that  journalism should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. We wonder if this ideal can be in conflict with the traditionally held view that journalism should be objective.</p>
<p>As always &#8211; Spot.Us is not, nor do we claim to be, a polling organization. That said, these are real answers from real people from all over the world including Japan and Guatemala. See the <a href="../2011/06/29/palin-and-weiner-is-it-worth-your-attention/">first Whitman Institute survey here</a> and the <a href="http://blog.spot.us/2011/08/10/how-do-we-discuss-the-news/">second here</a>.</p>
<p>We did find some of the results very curious and perhaps contradictory. It seems that when talking about ourselves we think the media has some influence. When asked if the media has influenced a voting decision, the answers between 1 (agree very little) and 5 (agree strongly) were spread out. But when asked how much influence the media might have on other&#8217;s &#8211; we place a little more agency.</p>
<p><a title="How the Media Influences The, But Not You by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6071865999/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6071865999_3e57afce66_z.jpg" alt="How the Media Influences The, But Not You" width="600" height="463" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We find a similar spread when asking how the media might influence the way one frames or talks about an issue.</p>
<p><a title="How the Media Influences The, But Not You by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6072407990/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6079/6072407990_bf33f06710_o.jpg" alt="How the Media Influences The, But Not You" width="600" height="463" /></a><br />
Certainly we acknowledge the media plays a role. But it seems somewhat even-handed. Yet when we discuss the influence the media may have had on &#8220;the masses&#8221; in their voting decisions we see a strong curve that shows a trend towards &#8220;strongly agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>We actually see similar trending charts around the media&#8217;s influence in the lead up to the Iraq war and the national debt ceiling discussion.</p>
<p><a title="How the Media Influences The, But Not You by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6072407792/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6072407792_fe3e5aa618_o.jpg" alt="How the Media Influences The, But Not You" width="600" height="463" /></a></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that while the trends are the same, it was the strongest around the influence of the Barack Obama 2008 campaign. The sentiment that the media played a role and influenced people was the strongest around this event and the weakest around the national deb ceiling discussion.</p>
<p>But again, all three charts suggest a similar trend in the way we think the media influences external events, specifically how people see politicians and national affairs. Meanwhile, we believe the media has less influence over our own voting habits.</p>
<p><a title="How the Media Influences The, But Not You by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6071865911/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6066/6071865911_963f8c6cde_o.jpg" alt="How the Media Influences The, But Not You" width="600" height="463" /></a></p>
<p>Sure enough there was one external event where our survey takers thought the media did not play an influential role. It was in the lead up to the housing crisis.</p>
<p><a title="How the Media Influences The, But Not You by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6072407752/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6207/6072407752_e3eabb0cff_o.jpg" alt="How the Media Influences The, But Not You" width="600" height="463" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no right/wrong when discussing if and how the media should be objective. From past Spot.Us surveys we can see it is a <a href="http://blog.spot.us/2010/08/31/what-you-think-of-objectivity-in-journalism/">dividing issue.</a> Many would argue that objectivity in journalism is impossible and in full disclosure (ha!) I am one of them. I do not think it is wrong to strive for objectivity, just that it is a fool&#8217;s errand in part because one of the goals of journalism is to have impact and influence. Without probing too deep, we asked if these two forces contradicted. Unsurprisingly we found the Spot.Us community to be somewhat divided on the issue. About half do not see a problem. One quarter do see an inherent problem and another quarter are unsure.</p>
<p>Can the media be influential and objective at the same time.<br />
<a title="How the Media Influences The, But Not You by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6072408068/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6072408068_ae68678c71_o.jpg" alt="How the Media Influences The, But Not You" width="600" height="463" /></a><br />
As we finish off most of our surveys we asked an open ended question. This allows us to get some anecdotal responses in addition to our analytical numbers. On par with the Spot.Us community there were more interesting responses than we could display. Below are some of the highlights. The responses below are anonymous and unedited.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Television media is uniquely influential, and almost always negative in its effect. It lacks context, reporting, and hard-questioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The media can play an influential role if it wants to. We currently have a polemic media, in many countries not just the US. You could argue that this media landscape leads to heightened tensions between the political parties, that media influences not only the public but the political process too. In terms of the recent debt ceiling &#8220;crises&#8221; both sides played out their part for their supporters, as usual. In terms of actual events, this only pushes the problem back a bit, it also did nothing to stop the downgrading of the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly this is a bad influence, on the positive side, the reaction to Katrina, Haiti, to Japan, to international and national events that require the mobilisation of people is to be lauded. I doubt that the media influence happens too often, it certainly is not never. Perhaps we are now more aware of this influence, from politicians down to the public. We also have a public that can self-broadcast so more examples of influence are reported.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how &#8220;played an influential role&#8221; is defined. I certainly pay attention to the media&#8211;what&#8217;s reported&#8211;and consider what the main players (Congress, the President, etc.) are saying and doing. I pay very little attention to the &#8220;talking heads&#8221; and their interpretation of the issues. I do listen&#8211;I&#8217;m intellectually curious&#8211;but just because some commentator on Fox or MSNBC believes a certain way doesn&#8217;t really affect me. Also, many non-media people have a tendency to want to &#8220;kill the messenger.&#8221; For example, I&#8217;m also a Realtor. I&#8217;m amazed at how many real estate agents blame the media for the poor real estate market. Yes, the media are reporting on it, and sometimes oversimplify issues. But the fact that people aren&#8217;t buying, the fact that housing prices in some areas have declined 30%-50%, the fact that foreclosures and short sales are up sharply&#8211;all that has virtually nothing to do with the media. Yet many agents really seem to blame the media for the poor condition of the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking as a journalist, I don&#8217;t believe that the media CAN be objective. Everything from which stories are covered and in what light, to which experts are called in to comment frame the way the public will view an issue and the reasons behind those decisions are almost never objective. I think the best we can hope for is media that is honest and accountable for their coverage but sadly that happens way too little—especially on television.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live in Japan, and I see that many Japanese people are way too easily influenced by the media on everything from what they eat, what they want and and what they think. It&#8217;s almost like people have stopped thinking. Many people confuse that information from the media is their own opinion. There are a lot of not very wise talk show hosts and university professors who talk blindly and people believe them. I think it is very scary. Media is man made, and subjectivity of the journalist is never to be avoided. I think we all need to realize that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s bad that the media is influential, if it is in fact media that you are watching/reading/listening too. If someone listen&#8217;s to only Rush Limbaugh or watches Keith Olberman and think that because they are on a news station, that it is news, that&#8217;s a problem. Today there are so many different media outlets, it&#8217;s important to check out more than one, so that you are sure you&#8217;re getting the whole story. I live in Boston where the Globe and Herald cover stories differently. I like to read both, because some details that are in one might not be in the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The media ALWAYS plays an influential role. People believe what they read and hear. People adopt what they read and hear as their own opinion. Most people prefer to be among the majority rather than the minority, so if the media present one side of an issue as the majority view (whether or not it really is), people adopt that view and it in fact becomes the majority view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you get your information from the media, they in turn play an influential role period. I think that when it is honest, unbiased media, then it is a positive thing. However, media these days are often accurate and unbiased. A lot of people go around quoting incorrect and bias information and it is very harmful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Guatemala, it is mostly bad. The media is controlled by a few powerful groups, it is only through alternative sources that one can get some balance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Still in its infancy Google+ has been the topic of many-a-tech blogposts. As a former tech-writer <a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2010/08/2578">I love and hate this stuff</a>. Sometimes I want to slap Mashable right in the &#8216;http&#8217; and tell them to never do another &#8220;Top X Ways [name your industry professionals] Can Use [new social networking tool].&#8221; If you are curious though &#8211; here are the  <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/17/journalists-using-google-plus/">top five ways journalists can use Google+</a> courtesy of Mashable.</p>
<p>Equally I want to avoid speculation about Google vs. Facebook. There is already plenty of that. If a Facebook executive has a sneeze that sounds like &#8216;ahh-choogle&#8217; the tech-press is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/8706645/Facebook-Google-has-no-users.html">all over it</a>. I personally am not a fan of Facebook and welcome my Google+ overlords. I do have a post in me about privacy, silicon valley speculation, etc &#8211; but I don&#8217;t want to add my voice to that already loud chorus.</p>
<p>Instead I want to write about Google+ in terms of everyday average use. Both how journalists use the Internet and how everyday average people use the internet (assuming the later is slightly different).</p>
<p>Sure enough 10,000 Words (the Mashable of journalism blogging) recently did a post on the <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/the-top-10-ways-journalists-use-the-internet_b5835">top 10 ways journalists use the Internet</a>. This is the ENTIRE internet mind you &#8211; but the results of the study are revealing. According to research journalists use the Internet for&#8230;.</p>
<p>1. Reading news<br />
2. Searching for news sources/story idea<br />
3. Social networking<br />
4. Micro-blogging<br />
5. Blogging<br />
6. Watching webinars/webcasts<br />
7. Watching YouTube<br />
8. Exploring Wikis<br />
9. Producing/listening to podcasts<br />
10. Social bookmarking</p>
<p>By rough estimate I&#8217;d say six of those activities can be encapsulated by Google+ in a way that Facebook doesn&#8217;t (partly because Facebook looks like a user-interface designer puked on the screen). One could argue with Google Hangouts you can add another one or two activities to the count and considering the network is still young, who knows where it could go.</p>
<p>While I won&#8217;t venture what the top 10 Internet activities are for non-journalists I suspect the majority of them are social in nature, including email (gmail having lots of penetration) and research (Google again). Now we can start to see some real <a href="http://robinsloan.com/epic/">Epic 2014 scariness/potential</a>.</p>
<p>The real lesson here is that journalists on Google+ should keep in mind how they are using the platform and how the public might be using the platform. The two aren&#8217;t necessarily the same and all-too often we think the rest of the world uses web technology the same way we do. Whenever I want to be humbled I watch a member of my family use the computer and think to myself &#8211; ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason to be on Google+ isn&#8217;t because it&#8217;s the newest, hottest, sexiest thing. That might be a good reason to be on it as an individual (hard to seperate) but not why you should be on it as a journalist. You should be on these sites to understand how people are communicating and the vocabulary of this communication. <a href="http://blog.digidave.org/2009/02/what-is-and-isnt-important-to-learn-lessons-from-friendster">Friendster informed MySpace which informed Facebook which informed Google+</a>. If you ignore these sites you will fail to understand how a growing portion of the population deals with the flow of information and inevitably how more people will deal with this flow in the future.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you are a journalist your JOB is to understand and insert yourself into the flow of information.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journalism gives a community something to talk about. The next day at the water cooler with your co-workers, at the dinner table with your family or at the bar with your friends, what&#8217;s on the news sets the topic of conversation.</p>
<p>One could argue that this is one reason why journalism and the media are so important. They set the agenda for local and national conversations. It gives us space and a reason to face ourselves, confront topics and converse with our neighbors. With the help of the <a href="http://www.thewhitmaninstitute.org/">Whitman Institute</a> sponsorship Spot.Us is exploring how we talk about the news with our colleagues, what we discuss and why. The results of our last 200 person survey are below with some analysis. See the <a href="http://blog.spot.us/2011/06/29/palin-and-weiner-is-it-worth-your-attention/">first Whitman Institute survey here</a>.</p>
<p>Our next Whitman Institute survey just went up. You can go to Spot.Us and click &#8220;free credits&#8221; on any pitch. Taking the survey not only informs what we know about how you think/use the media &#8211; but funds an the independent reporting project of your choice!</p>
<p>As always it&#8217;s important to note that Spot.Us is not a polling company, but these do represent real answers from unique individuals.</p>
<p>Our first question was just to see if indeed people do discuss the news with family, co-workers or friends. Only 1 percent of respondents didn&#8217;t discuss the news at all. The majority (57 percent) of responders say they discussed the news on a daily basis with another 25 percent saying they discussed the news &#8220;a few times&#8221; in the past week.</p>
<p><a title="How we discuss the news by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6029498111/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6029498111_4dd6aafe9d.jpg" alt="How we discuss the news" width="500" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The next question we wanted to ask was about the nature of the conversation. So much of our political discourse is polarized. We wanted to get a sense of whether or not that was the case in our every day lives too. Do conversations around the news get too heated? Or are we simply talking with folks we already agree with avoiding any debate or confrontation?</p>
<p>According to the survey results about half of the conversations we have on the news are &#8220;a back and forth conversation, cordial with disagreement.&#8221; Only 5 percent report having a heated debate with another 32 percent saying that the conversations were cordial because &#8220;we saw eye-to-eye on the issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many ways to interpret these results. That half of our conversations are cordial with disagreements does show a strong contrast with what we are presented on television, where almost every conversation turns into a shouting match. And yet roughly a third of our conversations are with people that we already agree with. While I think we could use less polarized bickering on cable television, perhaps we could use some more heated (but healthy) debate in our everyday conversations?</p>
<p><a title="How we discuss the news by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6030052618/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6130/6030052618_db89154498.jpg" alt="How we discuss the news" width="500" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>All bar graph results mean that individuals could choose multiple answers. This means the total possible number of &#8216;votes&#8217; was out of 200 instead of a percentage in a pie chart of 100.</p>
<p>When we asked individuals who they discussed the news with, it turns out that the winner was &#8220;friends.&#8221; Nearly 80 percent of all respondents or 157 individuals discussed the news with their friends in the past week. Family was a close second and only 94 individuals (nearly 50 percent) discussed the news with co-workers.</p>
<p>Something the graph below doesn&#8217;t show was where answers overlapped. Almost all individuals that discussed the news with co-workers also discussed it with friends. If you discussed the news with family you were more likely to also discuss it with your friends than co-workers. It was these two predispositions that allowed &#8220;friends&#8221; to come out as the most popular answer.  Only 25 percent of respondents felt comfortable discussing the news with all three types equally.</p>
<p>Funny enough the most popular &#8220;other&#8221; example that was given was &#8211; strangers; either in person (on a bus) or online.</p>
<p><a title="How we discuss the news by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6029498435/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6029498435_9785ae1487.jpg" alt="How we discuss the news" width="500" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The survey results here were surprising because it goes against everything we hear about news preferences online. Instead of niche news (topical, including sports) being the most popular, it was the least. Perhaps because Spot.Us is a self-selecting community the most popular news to discuss was national and local news with international news following right behind. This could also be because during the survey the debt ceiling news was reaching a fever pitch and international markets are in turmoil.</p>
<p><a title="How we discuss the news by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6030052744/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/6030052744_15d3a531d4.jpg" alt="How we discuss the news" width="500" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The immediate positive aspect of this pitch is obvious. When discussing the news we feel stimulated. But because these answers are not mutually exclusive we also feel anxious, depressed and invigorated almost equally.</p>
<p>A total of 41 individuals or 20 percent of respondents said they only felt either depressed or anxious. Meanwhile 90 individuals or 45 percent felt either only invigorated or stimulated (51 individuals ONLY felt stimulated).</p>
<p><a title="How we discuss the news by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6030052670/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6030052670_8628100d29.jpg" alt="How we discuss the news" width="500" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The news we discussed was overwhelmingly abstracted from our deeply personal lives. The vast majority of the news we discussed impacts us in a broad sense ie: the national debt ceiling. But some of the open ended answers about what news we were reading shed light on this further. The 20 percent who discussed the news that did have a direct impact on their life felt a deep connection to the stories whether it was Carmageddon in Los Angeles or a local shooting.</p>
<p><a title="How we discuss the news by spotreporting, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29792566@N08/6030052790/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6030052790_7aa2e89974.jpg" alt="How we discuss the news" width="500" height="386" /></a></p>
<p><strong>OPEN ANSWERS: &#8220;Tell us about the story you discussed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>These are the full answers about news stories discussed by Spot.Us community members, but their names have been withheld.</strong></p>
<p><em>What DON&#8217;T I discuss? I&#8217;m obsessed with the Murdoch takedown. OBSESSED. I have discussed the debt crisis, local crime, the governor of my state and what he&#8217;s up to&#8230;I&#8217;m a big chatty newsy person. I love to talk about all the news all the time.</em></p>
<p><em>Carmageddon, obviously. Even my parents back in Boston had heard about it. I was actually kind of amazed it was national news, so we talked about that. </em></p>
<p><em>The women&#8217;s Soccer World Cup, the News of the World scandal,and a local issue concerning the merger of my city&#8217;s CVB and Office of Cultural Affairs</em></p>
<p><em>Michele Bachman and the catholic church</em></p>
<p><em>Schools, government (FL), peak oil, doom</em></p>
<p><em>Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s impact on politics in the UK and the US. The US national debt. Republicans.</em></p>
<p><em>Discussing impact of sunspot activity, global weirding + local weather</em></p>
<p><em>Political wrangling going on in Washinggton.</em></p>
<p><em>One story was about Seattle City Council passing an ordinance allowing food trucks on streets and not just private lots. Another was about the Women&#8217;s World Cup final game. Another was about the Seattle Sounders match.</em></p>
<p><em>Too many to mention. one that still stands out is a radio show on the situation of human trafficking, and the apathy of many that goes along. also the bay area seems to be an international hub of sorts for such illegal activities. who knows about such?</em></p>
<p><em>Police shooting of 19-year-old boy by SF Muni police. </em></p>
<p><em>I discuss news stories at least twice a day. Usually more often. This particular news story is regarding the fires in the Southwest, specifically New Mexico. Our drought. And the causes of the fires and drought = climate change.</em><br />
<em>Discussing news is helpful&#8230;.it informs life and makes us better, engaged people.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Sponsorship from<a href="http://www.thewhitmaninstitute.org/"> The Whitman Institute</a> Spot.Us will be conducting several community surveys about our media habits, attitudes and conversations.</p>
<p>The first of these surveys went up last week and looked at the release of Sarah Palin&#8217;s emails and Anthony Weiner&#8217;s photo scandal. We asked over 200 individuals how much time they dedicated to these media stories, if it was worth their attention and what (if anything) they&#8217;d rather see covered.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.spot.us/2011/06/29/palin-and-weiner-is-it-worth-your-attention/">You can find the full results of that survey published at the trusty Spot.Us blog</a>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the survey results are a secondary win to the primary of supporting independent journalists. Every person who takes a survey on Spot.Us earns credits that are directed to the reporting project of their choice and create real funds for that reporting endeavor. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Since the results of this first specific survey can be found on <a href="http://blog.spot.us/2011/06/29/palin-and-weiner-is-it-worth-your-attention/">Spot.Us&#8217; blog</a> I thought I&#8217;d take this space to look at the larger issue, especially since the Whitman Institute afforded us the ability to do several of these types of surveys I want to try and articulate what I hope we can achieve and open up to suggestions on what future surveys/polls/questionnaires might accomplish this.</p>
<p>One of the founding principles behind Spot.Us is that the public can and  should have a seat at the editorial table to determine what coverage  the media will serve. The media talks about this concept all the time  but rarely meets it head on. At best on cable networks you’ll see a few  minutes dedicated to reading Tweets on television. This is a kind of faux power. A manipulation of Andy Warhol&#8217;s 15-minutes of fame and passing that off as power (in modern society we too often interpret fame as power).</p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t the media (and I&#8217;m talking more about broadcast news for the moment) tackle this more head on? One could argue that they don&#8217;t need to. They are responding to what media consumers want. In fact, they cater to it already and that&#8217;s why we have news that skews towards the sensational. This leads to a chicken/egg dilemma. Do media consumers pay attention to sensational news because that&#8217;s what they want or because that&#8217;s the only thing they are served up.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is, if we are serious about this question, the answer is a bit of both. Turn on PBS Evening News and you are likely to start snoring. Turn on Fox News or CNN and you might have a seizure from all the flashing bright lights. I refuse to believe that these are the only two options we have. There must be a way in which we can seek the feedback of the public in determining coverage, reflect that in a serious manner without forcing consumers to feel as though we are force feeding them broccoli.</p>
<p>One type of organization that gives us glimpses into this middle road is the Pew Research Center for The People and the Press. Pew also runs the &#8220;<a href="http://www.journalism.org/">Project for Excellence in Journalism</a>.&#8221; In some respects what Spot.Us is attempting with these surveys is a quicker/lighter version of Pew polls that give us insight into how the public think/feels about topics.</p>
<p>While our method is less scientific, it is faster while maintaining a basis in real quantitative answers from a diverse but digitally savvy audience. Perhaps some day the Project for Excellence in Journalism will even help sponsor some of these surveys and thus help independent journalists at the same time.</p>
<p>The goal in these surveys is to get our fingers on the pulse of a conversation.</p>
<p>For example: If it was relevant we could launch a survey tomorrow about Google+ and Facebook.</p>
<p>Everyone is going to have their blog posts on the best features of Google+ or why it will/won&#8217;t be better than Facebook, etc. But one post by one person is just that. Even if I go out and aggregate several posts, it doesn&#8217;t take into consideration background information from those individuals or even ask them to tackle the same questions and that is what we really need in order to understand what Google+ is and how it may fit into our lives &#8211; by asking people who are using it.</p>
<p>I am not 100% sure what the topic of future surveys sponsored by the Whitman Institute will be. They&#8217;ve given us pretty open ground. At the same time I want to stay true to the parts of their mission which overlap with Spot.Us&#8217; &#8211; to give a platform for the general public to converse and understand what they want from media and hopefully have the media respond back in kind.</p>
<p>I want to keep my ear low to the ground and create surveys around topics that have varying opinions but one where nobody is really asking the right/tough questions of THE PUBLIC and not just media insiders asking themselves or &#8216;experts&#8217; what is important to understand for a given topic.</p>
<p>We want to know what drives conversation, how those conversations spread and why. What is or isn&#8217;t important to media consumers. What threads they follow, what threads they spread and what influence that might have.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for future survey topics &#8211; send them my way. Note: The next two weeks I will be more or less offline (getting nuptial&#8217;d) but upon my return we will take a close look at where the media is taking the public and give the public a chance to respond.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s post is for a very special reader. He is my first and most loyal reader. Whenever I spend time with him, he comments on my most recent post and so this one is for him. It&#8217;s the Digi-Dad, My father. Since I&#8217;m not in physical proximity to hand a gift to him I&#8217;m writing an ode to Dad for this year&#8217;s father day.</p>
<p><em>Below is a picture of my father and I back-to-back. I am probably 18 years old. Our uncle is using my father&#8217;s cane to show that I am indeed, just a smidgen taller than my old man.</em></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3364" href="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-18-at-9.42.20-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3364" title="Screen shot 2011-06-18 at 9.42.20 PM" src="http://blog.digidave.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-18-at-9.42.20-PM.png" alt="" width="497" height="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gained a lot from my father over the years. I think my love of writing first came from his influence. I can distinctly remember as a child (6 or 7 years old) professing that I wanted to be a stand up comedian when I grew up. Now that I&#8217;m older I can appreciate my father&#8217;s reaction. He didn&#8217;t wince or show any fear that his son was going to grow up traveling from bar to bar trying to earn money for laughs. Instead &#8211; he told me that to be a good comedian I first had to become an effective communicator and a good writer. In my minds ear I can hear him put emphasis and enunciation on &#8220;effective communicator&#8221; breaking out the syllables &#8220;commune-a-cat-or.&#8221; That can leave an impression on a kid growing up.</p>
<p>I can remember when my father taught me to ride a bike. We went to my elementary school on a weekend so the concrete playground was empty. He ran alongside me and without letting me know &#8211; just let go and continued keeping pace with the bike. Once I could bike my father would include me on his weekend ritual which consisted of going to the Santa Monica Pier and bike along Venice Beach and eat at the Boardwalk Cafe. Then we&#8217;d bike back to our car at the pier. For my father it wasn&#8217;t just about exercise &#8211; it was a community of people he would visit. He knew all the local panhandlers, artists, fortune tellers, etc. Throughout the 80&#8242;s and early 90&#8242;s if you went to Venice Beach you probably saw Scott the sand artist, George the Wizard and Joe the Tour Guide among other local fixtures. My father would chat with them every weekend to see how they were doing. One year George the Wizard (a fortune teller) even came to Thanksgiving. That was a trip <img src='http://blog.digidave.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  To this day biking is one of my favorite exercise activities in part because I feel like it&#8217;s an instant way to get to know a community.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget the first lesson in driving my father gave me. It&#8217;s simple, effective and something I keep in mind to this day. Whenever you are behind the wheel, he said &#8220;assume everyone is an idiot.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone in the world is actually an idiot &#8211; but when you are driving you have to assume that the other person is going to miss the stop sign, red light, forget who has the ride-away or any other number of dumb things. In short this line &#8220;assume everyone is an idiot&#8221; was his way of stressing defensive driving. It was small lessons like that and his ability to get them across that always had impact.</p>
<p>Man could my dad tell a story. I&#8217;ll never forget one Cub Scout camping trip when he told the story of the Black Momba (a deadly snake). He made every kid under the age of 9 cry. Being 11 at the time I thought my dad was the coolest. He was banned from telling scary stories at the next Cub Scout camping trip. How badass is that!</p>
<p>I also think my propensity for technology comes somewhat influenced from my father. An avid science fiction fan (like his mother) my father has always been an early adopter of technology. We had an Apple II C computer starting when I was about eight years old. Around 11 years old he taught me how to get online using Prodigy and after that America Online. In the early 90&#8242;s I also started noticing a bold neon magazine &#8220;Wired&#8221; would show up at our house.Working at Wired.com for awhile was really my first head-dive into the world of technology. I often say it was the saving grace of my career but it was also something that I knew my father was proud of. From then on he took a deep interest in all things digital that I participated in. I think my father&#8217;s appreciation for science fiction and technology come from a very intellectual place (he watches Wrestling too, so not everything is refined about him). His father was a renaissance man and a bit of an inventor and my father looks to these things as a way to glimpse into the future.</p>
<p>We would talk about these little things over the years whenever we&#8217;d  go in the spa in our backyard. That was more or less where we did male  bonding. It was where we talked about how I was doing in school, where  he taught me about money management, talked to me about sex/drugs and  all that other father/son stuff.</p>
<p>My father, for all his craziness, is a pretty wise guy. For all his apparent callousness (and he can be crass) is also very kind. Even after retiring he still volunteers at a nonprofit that provides free legal advice to those who can&#8217;t afford it. When he was more active he would even go to churches to provide similar legal advice.</p>
<p>Not only is he a good father, but also an admirable person. I don&#8217;t write about personal life too often on this blog nor do I intend to that often &#8211; but it&#8217;s important to put all that my father does in context. In the late 1980&#8242;s (I believe it was 88&#8242;) my father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He continued to work until just 2-3 years ago. If you know about M.S. then you&#8217;d know it&#8217;s a tough disease and can be painful. You&#8217;d never hear my father really complain, at least not to me or my sister. Instead, he was a strong pillar for the family. He never backed down from the work that he loved or his family. He excelled in life despite all obstacles. You want to talk about somebody with steadfast determination and composure &#8211; my father is the guy. At times this can express itself as stubborness (and he can be a stubborn bastard) but I wouldn&#8217;t change him for the world.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to the Digi-Dad: Harold Jonas Cohn. Happy daddy day! I&#8217;ll see you in a few weeks when you come up north for the big event!</p>
