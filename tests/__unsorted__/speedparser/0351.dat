  <title>A week in Milan</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-A-week-in-Milan-287.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<i>Your trip in one sentence</i><br />I went for a week in Milan for work and my friend Gus joined me there for the weekend.<br /><br /><i>Why did you travel there ?</i><br />I went for work for a few days and then decided to stay the weekend to enjoy the city and meet some people.<br /><br /><i>How did you get there ?</i><br />I arrived by train from Berne in Switzerland (where I was for work) which costed around 30&euro; and then I flew back to London by place. Easyjet from Bergamo, cheap but far away from the city centre !<br /><br /><i>Where did you sleep ?</i><br />In a &quot;business&quot; style hotel a bit far from the center. Not really the kind I like but it was paid by work.<br /><br /><i>What was your most interesting encounter ?</i><br />Before I arrived to Milan I contacted a few couchsurfers to see if they have some time to meet for a drink. We met two who were really cool and took us to some cool places in Milan. Also had a chance to meet an old friend who lives there and I hadn&#039;t seen for a while.<br /><br /><i>Tell us a story that happened to you there</i><br />Well the first Couchsurfer we met was with two friend. One of them was quite drunk which is fine with me. But unfortunately they started to fight each other at some point of the night, which led the friends to leave. That was a bit weird and sad because they all looked really cool but that kinda ruined the night. I&#039;d love to meet them again in different circumstances though...<br /><br /><i>What did you do at night ?</i><br />Wandered around as usually. I like the Navigli area which was very animated on the weekend. We went to a very cool Botellon with on of the Couchsurfer near the University (M&deg; Piola).<br /><br /><i>What were your cultural activities ?</i><br />Hum... Just visited the city and the castle.<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local word ?</i><br />Birra<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local food ?</i><br />Pizza of course !<br /><br /><i>Will you go again ?</i><br />Probably but only if I have people to meet there or can show me around.<br /><br />]]></description>

  <title>3rd trip to NY</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-3rd-trip-to-NY-264.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<i>Your trip in one sentence</i><br />A fast 10-day trip to enjoy the city like as a temporary New-Yorker<br /><br /><i>Why did you travel there ?</i><br />I went to visit my buddy Johnny who has moved there recently from California<br /><br /><i>How did you get there ?</i><br />Continental flight from London Heathrow to Newark airport. For your information Newark airport sucks !<br /><br /><i>Where did you sleep ?</i><br />On a quite uncomfortable couch but I was so tired every night that I was always happy to find it again... Destroyed my back though.<br /><br /><i>What was the biggest cultural shock ?</i><br />I&#039;m always disturbed by the salesperson in stores. They come to you and start talking to you as if you were their friends. I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing but I don&#039;t like thinking that it&#039;s all about the tips and commission... As they say : &quot;the customer is king&quot;. <br /><br /><i>What was your most interesting encounter ?</i><br />I&#039;ve met a lot of interesting and fun people. But I think the one I&#039;ll remember for ever is Bill, who&#039;s my friend Johnny drunk evil twin.<br /><br /><i>What did you do at night ?</i><br />As usually we went from adventures to adventures in East Village and Brooklyn. From houseparties to dark restaurants. From classy bars to beer pong tables. From gigs to gay bars. Every night was a new adventure and I loved it !<br /><br /><i>What were your cultural activities ?</i><br />I went to the MoMa to see the Tim Burton exhibit. But the end I think I was even more impressed by the work of Kentridge. Of maybe not more cause Tim Burton&#039;s work is simply amazing...<br /><br /><i>Which song illustrates best your trip ?</i><br />Empire State of Mind - Jay-Z feat. Alicia Keys. Of course...<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local word ?</i><br />Mothafuckaaaaaaaaa<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local food ?</i><br />You know me, I like simple things. The burger from Prime Meats was simply delicious. Especially compared to London dirty steaks. That was the best burger I had in a while...<br /><br /><i>Your favourite place ?</i><br />It&#039;s funny cause I&#039;d be tempted to say the &quot;Legion Bar in Brooklyn&quot; as they suggest in the examples. But actually I think I liked the Brooklyn Social even more. Or maybe Moto restaurant (also in Brooklyn)<br /><br /><i>Will you go again ?</i><br />I will definitely go back soon. That&#039;s one of my favourite cities in the world   !<br /><br />]]></description>

  <title>Have you ever been to Bratislava ?</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-Have-you-ever-been-to-Bratislava--263.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<i>Your trip in one sentence</i><br />The first stop of a 10-day journey in Eastern Europe<br /><br /><i>Why did you travel there ?</i><br />The main goal of our trip was to spent the new year&#039;s eve in Prague with my Canadian friend Daniel. But when we checked the tickets we figured it would be cheaper and more interesting to arrive in Bratislava and then quickly visit Vienna before taking a 5-hour train to Prague.<br /><br /><i>How did you get there ?</i><br />A cheap Ryanair flight (around 80&amp;euro;)<br /><br /><i>Where did you sleep ?</i><br />I tried contacting couchsurfers in Bratislava but unfortunately, none was available to host me and my 2 friends. I know it would be complicated to be hosted at this time of the year and so we quickly booked a hostel. And it turned out that Hostel Blues was really nice. Very good cool staff, nice location and great rooms.<br /><br /><i>What was the biggest cultural shock ?</i><br />I&#039;m quite used to Eastern Europe as I&#039;ve travelled there many times already. I was quite impressed with the local beers that are all over 10&deg;. And very cheap (~1,5&amp;euro; a pint).<br />
I liked how people were generally very nice.<br /><br /><i>What was your most interesting encounter ?</i><br />Our two roommates at the Hostel were quite nice. Other than that I must admit that there was not a lot of unusual encounters.<br /><br /><i>What did you do at night ?</i><br />Our usual night cruising in the empty streets of Bratislava. It was weekdays but we still quite a lot of places to have drinks and even a decent party on tuesday night at Infinity<br /><br /><i>What were your cultural activities ?</i><br />To be honest, Bratislava is quite a poor city in term of Culture. There&#039;s a castle you can visit on top of the hill but it&#039;s nothing really crazy.<br />
You have to remember that Bratislava is only a capital city since 1993 and used to be only a neighbouring city of Vienna.<br />
The old town is still nice to visit and you can occupy yourself easily for a day. <br /><br /><i>Which song illustrates best your trip ?</i><br />Bratisla Boys - Stach Stach<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local word ?</i><br />Can&#039;t remember any...<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local food ?</i><br />The food was very good usually but we had a few surprises as we couldn&#039;t always understand what we ordered.<br />
My favourite meal was the chease/meat dumplings I think.<br /><br /><i>Your favourite place ?</i><br />The Slovak Pub which was recommend to me by a couchsurfer and were you have tasty cheap beers and food.<br /><br /><i>Will you go again ?</i><br />Probably not tomorrow but someday why not if I have someone to visit over there.<br /><br />]]></description>

  <title>3 guys in Glasgow</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-3-guys-in-Glasgow-258.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<i>Your trip in one sentence</i><br />2 french guys visiting their good canadian friend in Glasgow for 3 days of fun, culture and beers.<br /><br /><i>Why did you travel there ?</i><br />To visit my good friend Dan from Canada. That was also a birthday gift for my friend Ben who traveled with me.<br /><br /><i>How did you get there ?</i><br />By plane with easyjet for a really cheap price.<br /><br /><i>Where did you sleep ?</i><br />We spent 2 nights in Glasgow and were hosted by Dan who incidentally I met though Couchsurfing.org. I can vouch that his couches were incredibly confortable !<br /><br /><i>What was the biggest cultural shock ?</i><br />I would be tempted to say the accent but I was already expecting it. I was quite impressed with the really cheap alcohol and how much the Glaswegian can drink !<br /><br /><i>What did you do at night ?</i><br />Usual pub crawl and night craziness in the center of Glasgow. We were also invited to a really nice bbq in Dan&#039;s family were we met a lot of very nice local people.<br /><br /><i>What were your cultural activities ?</i><br />Contrary to a popular belief Glasgow is a beatiful city full of interesting things to see and visit. I especially liked the Kelvingrove museum for it&#039;s very eclectic collection. There&#039;s a little bit of everything and the building itself is really impressive. Definitely a must see ! And most of the museums are free...<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local word ?</i><br />sl&agrave;inte (pronounces slendge or something like that) = cheers in scottish !<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local food ?</i><br />Nothing really local but we had an amazing bbq<br /><br /><i>Your favourite place ?</i><br />I really liked most of the places we went in Glasgow but I especially enjoyed walking along the river in Kelvingrove Garden<br /><br /><i>Will you go again ?</i><br />I would probably not go to Scotland just to go back to Glasgow but if I have a chance I&#039;d like to tour a little bit in the Scottish countryside and up north. And if I can spend a few days in Glasgow at the same occasion that would be perfect...<br /><br />]]></description>

  <title>Welcome to Seattle</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-Welcome-to-Seattle-256.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<i>Your trip in one sentence</i><br />A few days in a great city with great people !<br /><br /><i>Why did you travel there ?</i><br />Seattle is the second city of my big West Coast tour during summer 2009. I went there because I have my good frien Sean who lives there and I knew I would show me around. We definitely had good time :)<br /><br /><i>How did you get there ?</i><br />Greyhound bus from Vancouver. Around 4 hours ride which wasn&#039;t too bad.<br /><br /><i>Where did you sleep ?</i><br />We were hosted by my friend Sean in a really cool area near the Seattle University.<br /><br /><i>What was the biggest cultural shock ?</i><br />Seattle is a really modern and liberal city. It&#039;s definitely nothing like most of the US and so the people you will meet there are really close to european people I found. Except they give hugs to greet each other... :)<br /><br /><i>What was your most interesting encounter ?</i><br />We have met a lot of people through our host and they were all super cool, fun and really interesting. They gave us good tips for the rest of our trip and we had two nights of really good fun !<br /><br /><i>Tell us a story that happened to you there</i><br />We (10 people) were at a bar called the Chapel and we litteraly started a party over there. Even if we only go for drinks we always end up partying and dancing !!<br />
You can hire us as party starters if you want. We will only charge you the booze !<br /><br /><i>What did you do at night ?</i><br />First night was monday night and I thought there would be nothing opened. Apparently in Seattle monday is the last day of the weekend and there was a lot of people in the bars and we had a really crazy night (including shots of tequila and piggybacking). We were to Moe&#039;s Bar, Cha Cha and Linda&#039;s (as far as I remember).<br />
The second was a little more quiet but was still really funny as we started a proper party at the Chapel.<br /><br /><i>What were your cultural activities ?</i><br />We just walked around the city and admired the space needle from afar. We also were to Sculpture Park which is part of the MoMa Seattle.<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local word ?</i><br />&quot;Awesome&quot;<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local food ?</i><br />A nice big burger of course !<br /><br /><i>Your favourite place ?</i><br />A club called the Cha Cha. Really cool !<br /><br /><i>Will you go again ?</i><br />Definitely ! I think I could even live there for a while if I happened to find a good job in the area.<br /><br />]]></description>

  <title>Je suis enfin allé à Berlin !</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-Je-suis-enfin-all--Berlin--250.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<i>Your trip in one sentence</i><br />Une d&eacute;couverte passionnante de cette ville tr&egrave;s impressionnante !<br /><br /><i>Why did you travel there ?</i><br />J&#039;ai eu l&#039;occasion d&#039;aller &agrave; Berlin en f&eacute;vrier 2009 car je devais aller en mission &agrave; Dusseldorf pour le boulot. J&#039;ai donc profit&eacute; du weekend pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent pour visiter Berlin que je n&#039;avais jamais fais. En plus, j&#039;ai un ami d&#039;enfance qui habite l&agrave; bas et que je n&#039;avais pas vu depuis presque 10 ans donc c&#039;etait &eacute;galement l&#039;occasion parfaite de le revoir.<br /><br /><i>How did you get there ?</i><br />Un avion via Air Berlin qui propose des prix tr&egrave;s interessant.<br /><br /><i>Where did you sleep ?</i><br />J&#039;ai dormi chez mon ami Arkadi, un ami d&#039;enfance qui m&#039;a heberg&eacute; pendant les 4 jours que j&#039;ai pass&eacute; &agrave; Berlin.<br /><br /><i>What was the biggest cultural shock ?</i><br />Sans h&eacute;sitation, la vie la nuit ! Berlin est une ville qui vit 24/24 et c&#039;est vraiment tr&egrave;s impressionnant. Que ce soit pour boire un verre, manger un morceau ou aller dans une rave underground, vous trouverez toujours un endroit o&ugrave; aller quelque ce soit l&#039;heure du jour ou de la nuit. Venant de Londres o&ugrave; la ville est d&eacute;sert&eacute; tr&egrave;s t&ocirc;t (2h max) je dois dire que ca m&#039;a fais un sacr&eacute; choc.<br />
Sur un autre plan, j&#039;ai &eacute;t&eacute; assez etonn&eacute; de constater que les allemands ne parlaient pas beaucoup mieux que les fran&ccedil;ais. Bon je sais c&#039;est pas tr&egrave;s dur mais on dis souvent que les allemands parlent tous tr&egrave;s bien anglais. Ce n&#039;est pas du tout vrai comme cela pourrait l&#039;&ecirc;tre dans les pays scandinaves par exemples.<br /><br /><i>What did you do at night ?</i><br />Gr&acirc;ce aux amis que j&#039;avais sur place, j&#039;ai eu l&#039;occasion de faire des choses tr&egrave;s diverses. Evidemment je suis all&eacute; dans de nombreux bar d&eacute;guster des bi&egrave;res allemandes. Mais je suis aussi all&eacute; dans une soir&eacute;e techno alternative underground dans une sorte d&#039;entrep&ocirc;t desaffect&eacute;. Tr&egrave;s impressionnant ! Je suis aussi all&eacute; &agrave; des concerts de jazz et de swing.<br />
Je pense que j&#039;ai eu un petit panorama de l&#039;activit&eacute; nocturne de la ville mais loin d&#039;&ecirc;tre exhaustif. Il y a tellement de choses diff&eacute;rentes &agrave; Berlin que l&#039;on en fait rarement le tour &agrave; mon avis.<br /><br /><i>What were your cultural activities ?</i><br />J&#039;ai &eacute;t&eacute; au mus&eacute;e de la technologie qui est super int&eacute;ressant (pour les geeks comme moi en tout cas ;) et que je recommande.<br />
J&#039;ai &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;galement aux portes de Brandebourg qui se trouve juste &agrave; cot&eacute; de l&#039;ambassade de France o&ugrave; se trouve de nombreux panneaux retra&ccedil;ant l&#039;histoire du mur de Berlin.<br />
Et pour finir, j&#039;ai fais de nombreuses partie de baby foot, l&#039;activit&eacute; nationale dans les bars de Berlin. G&eacute;n&eacute;ralement un haut lieu pour les rencontres et les &eacute;changes multi-culturelles ! Alors entrainez-vous avant de partir :)<br /><br /><i>Which song illustrates best your trip ?</i><br />Night Vision - Daft Punk<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local word ?</i><br />Brandenburg Tor<br /><br /><i>Your favourite local food ?</i><br />Je pense pas avoir gout&eacute; quoi que ce soit de vraiment allemand. J&#039;ai bien aim&eacute; leur petit d&eacute;jeuner cela dis.<br /><br /><i>Will you go again ?</i><br />Oui c&#039;est s&ucirc;r. Peut-&ecirc;tre &agrave; l&#039;occasion des 20 ans de la chute du mur en octobre 2009...<br /><br />]]></description>

  <title>Krakow - the little Prague</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-Krakow--the-little-Prague-198.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty=""><span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Krakow</span> - the little Prague</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>I've been in Krakow in <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">february 2007</span> with a few friends, just a week after <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">Easyjet </span>opened the airline Paris - Krakow ! We took the tickets in advance so it actually costed us only 50&euro; to get there. Great deal !<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>We decided to go there because my parents where in Krakow the previous summer. They told me it was <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">like&nbsp;Prague, just a little smaller</span>. I didn't need more to get convinced... And when we saw the advertising of the new line opening by Easyjet, we knew it was time for us to go !<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>We took off thursday early in the morning and arrived around 10pm in the city. When we arrived we were ready to get the usual "taxi rip off". And first good surprise, there's a <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">shuttle</span> taking the passengers straight from the airport to the center of the city for about 2&euro; (8zl). Then, we had about 2 hours to wait until we can get the keys of the flat we rented, so we took a <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">breakfast </span>on the central square.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Let me tell you right now, that <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">I really liked the city</span>. I liked everything about it : the architecture, the bars, the people, the restaurant, the jewish quarter... If you liked Prague, you'll definitely like Krakow. And there are several things that I even liked better in Krakow. For instance, we almost never had trouble talking in english with people, whereas in Prague we struggled a lot about that. That may be explained by the fact that Krakow has a lot of <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">students</span>. That's also something you really feel at night as there's a lot of young people everywhere. <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Night cruising there is definitely a lot of fun !</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>						As I said, we stayed in a flat we rented via a <span><a class="linkinchron" href="http://www.discovercracow.com/" target="_blank" title="web">website</a></span>. The price was a little high but that's all that was the only flat left at the time we made the reservation. But it was extremely well located, 1min away from the central square by foot. Right in the center for action !<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>There are mainly 2 interesting area in Krakow : the <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">central square</span> and <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">Kazimierz</span>. <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Central square is a highly touristic</span> place where you find the <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">big cathedral</span> of Krakow, a lot of <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">restaurants</span> and <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">nightclubs</span>. That's were we lived and spent most of our time because that's were there's the most thing to do. Yet my prefered area is the <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">jewish quarter</span> : Kazimierz. We had dinner there almost every night and to me, the jewish restaurant are the best in Krakow. You can enjoy great dishes like <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">Pirogis</span> and at the same time listen to <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">Klezmer music</span>. I highly recommend <span><a class="lieu_inchron" href="http://www.hejorama.com/lieu-Once-upon%20a%20time-511.html">Once upon a time</a> for that !</span> And after dinner, Kazimierz has a great variety of <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 255);">bars</span> to have a few drinks before going back to central square where most the clubs are. <br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>About the museums, we were really disappointed as most (if not all) were <span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">closed during the winter season</span>. So we only been to Krakow castle which is pretty interesting but again most of it was closed so it was a quick visit.						If go back during summer, I'll update this part of my chronicle !<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>To sum up : <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">Krakow rocks and you shoudl really go there once you've been in Prague !</span><br/>]]></description>

  <title>Naples - sur les traces des Sopranos</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-Naples--sur-les-traces-des-Sopranos-175.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[A l'occasion du kick-off annuel de ma soci&eacute;t&eacute;, je suis parti &agrave; <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Naples</span> pour quatre jours. Au d&eacute;part j'&eacute;tais un peu perplexe sur le choix de la destination et puis finalement &ccedil;a m'a sembl&eacute; une assez bonne id&eacute;e car je n'y serais probablement pas aller autrement.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Quelques semaines avant de partir, je suis tomb&eacute; par hasard sur un &eacute;pisode des <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Sopranos</span> (e04s2) o&ugrave; Tony, Paulie et Chris partent &agrave; Naples et j'ai constat&eacute; que la ville avait l'air tr&egrave;s jolie d'autant que dans l'&eacute;pisode, le soleil &eacute;tait radieux. Dommage pour nous, il a plu quasiment pendant les 4 jours o&ugrave; nous &eacute;tions l&agrave; bas...<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>La ville en elle m&ecirc;me est plutot <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);" _moz_dirty="">pitoresque</span> bien que les batiments soient souvent un peu d&eacute;crepis. Pourtant le charme de la ville est ind&eacute;niable et j'ai bien aim&eacute; me promener dans les ruelles du <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);" _moz_dirty="">centre historique</span> qui s'etend entre la <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Via Toledo</span>, la <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Piazza Cavour</span> et la <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Via Duomo</span>.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Sur un plan <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">culturel</span>, je vous recommande vivement la visite de <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Pompei</span> qui est vraiment tr&egrave;s impressionante. Je ne m'attendais &agrave; ce que tous soient si bien conserv&eacute;s. On se prom&egrave;ne dans la ville telle qu'&eacute;tait lors de l'&eacute;ruption. De plus, nous avons eu la chance d'avoir un guide avec nous pendant le s&eacute;jour et &agrave; Pompei, il nous a racont&eacute; de nombreuses anecdotes passionnantes sur la vie de l'&eacute;poque. Nous avons vraiment voyag&eacute; dans le temps ! (plus de d&eacute;tails : pompei).<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>L'autre excursion "culturelle" au programme : <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Capri</span>. Cette &icirc;le qui se trouve &agrave; 50mn de bateau de Naples est connu de tous. Sans en avoir quasiment jamais entendu parler, je me la representais exactement telle que j'ai pu la voir l&agrave; : <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);" _moz_dirty="">un haut lieu touristique</span> avec options japonais par dizaines, restaurant attrape touriste, tarifs exorbitants... Bref du vu et revu. Bon apr&egrave;s, je reconnais que c'est assez beau mais tr&egrave;s honnetement cela m'a laiss&eacute; assez insensible. Faut dire que je supporte mal les endroits trop touristiques dans ce genre, qui n'ont plus aucune authenticit&eacute;.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Au niveau du logement, tout &eacute;tait pris en charge par ma soci&eacute;t&eacute; donc je ne peux pas donner de pistes. Nous &eacute;tions au <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Royal Intercontinental</span> qui est un grand h&ocirc;tel tr&egrave;s luxueux avec des salles de conf&eacute;rences, etc... Tr&egrave;s confortable ;)						<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Pour les activit&eacute;s <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">nocturnes</span>, apr&egrave;s quelques d&eacute;ambulations nous avons d&eacute;couvert tout se pass&eacute; dans le <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">quartier de Chiaia</span>, une fois la nuit tomb&eacute;e. Ce quartier se trouve un peu plus haut que le front de mer (Riviera Di Chiaia) et devient tr&egrave;s <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);" _moz_dirty="">ambianc&eacute;</span> la nuit. Au programme plusieurs clubs et bars sont &agrave; votre disposition. Je vous recommande en particulier la rue&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Via Giuseppe Femigni</span> qui regroupe 4 ou 5 bars et qui est tr&egrave;s anim&eacute;e. En effet la plupart des gens sont dans la rue leur verre &agrave; la main et refont le monde en parlant fort et en gesticulant ( &agrave; l'italienne quoi...). Nous y avons pass&eacute; l'essentiel de nos soir&eacute;es.<br/>						<br/>]]></description>

  <title>Amsterdam aka a really clean Sin City</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;"><span _moz_dirty="" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Amsterdam</span> : a really clean Sin City<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/></span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 51, 255);" _moz_dirty="">"You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?", Vincent Vega</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Amsterdam... One of the most famous cities in the world and definitely one about which everything was said...<br _moz_dirty=""/>I was in Amsterdam for the first time in october 2007 with a some friends of mine. For the third time, I've made a "flat swap". I really love this concept. This time like the the two first, it went on really great and I'm really glad cause so far I've had only great experiences. This time, it was just too bad I hadn't the opportunity to meet the person I've swapped with.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>The flat was located in Pjip which is a nice neighboorhood not far from the actual center of Amsterdam. We had a wonderful sunny weather and as we arrived we really enjoyed the city. I must say right now that I think Amsterdam might be <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">one of the most beautiful cities</span> I've ever visited. I liked everything : the <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 153);" _moz_dirty="">buildings</span>, the <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 204);" _moz_dirty="">canals</span>, the <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 153);" _moz_dirty="">bikes</span>... Everybody is riding a bike, it's really pleasant to live in a city where there aren't much cars like that. Hopefully, Paris will be like that one day !<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>The first day we walked all around amazed by this city. We went in the&nbsp;<span><a href="lieu-Rusland-366.html" class="lieu_inchron">Rusland</a> coffee shop&nbsp;</span>and chilled for an hour while our feets were recovering for so much walk. We definitely should have taken bikes. <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">If you visit Amsterdam, do it with bikes !</span> You'll enjoy the city twice more. For the breakfast, I recommand <span><a href="lieu-Barney%27s-367.html" class="lieu_inchron">Barney's</a> a great coffee shop in <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Haarlem</span>, a really nice district you can visit once you've eaten your&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;" _moz_dirty="">Barney's special hamburger</span>.</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><span _moz_dirty="" style="text-decoration: underline;"><br _moz_dirty=""/></span>At night, we started our usual&nbsp;cruising in the city and found it actually <span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">really quiet</span>. We were all really disappointed to see how not lively the city was at night. We went to <span _moz_dirty=""><a href="lieu-Jimmy-Woo-376.html" class="lieu_inchron">Jimmy Woo</a> </span>which is supposed to be one of the greatest place in Amsterdam. When we were there, honestly there was nothing that crazy about it. The club is definitely fine but nothing to be excited about. I've seen far more exciting place in Miami, London or Budapest. Dutch people do not seem to be really the partying type of people. Nice but quiet and clean ;)<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Of course, at night you have the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 51, 102);" _moz_dirty="">Redlight District</span> dragging all the attention. But, to me, once you've walked five minutes in it, there's nothing really interesting to see but <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 153);" _moz_dirty="">strange guys</span> wandering and peeping at the girls. Or groups of young french, italian or english guys waiting for their friend who decided to step in of the girls' room.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>I was in Amsterdam for only two days&nbsp; so the only museum we've seen is the <span _moz_dirty=""><a href="lieu-Van-Gogh%20museum-375.html" class="lieu_inchron">Van Gogh museum</a> which is really interesting even for people like me who doesn't really get what painting is all about.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>To sum up I will say that I was really impressed by the city in itself but I was disappoited by the lack of entertainment at night. Maybe I'll have to go back with someone who can show me the good places !<br _moz_dirty=""/></span>						<br _moz_dirty=""/><span style="font-weight: bold;" _moz_dirty="">Facts :</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>						<span _moz_dirty="" style="font-style: italic;"><span _moz_dirty="" style="text-decoration: underline;">I didn't expect :</span> <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-style: italic;">that Amsterdam was so beautiful.<br _moz_dirty=""/></span><span _moz_dirty="" style="text-decoration: underline;">I didn't know :</span> <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-style: italic;">that selling alcohol is forbidden is coffee shops selling weed and stuff.<br _moz_dirty=""/></span><span _moz_dirty="" style="font-style: italic;"><span _moz_dirty="" style="text-decoration: underline;">I wasn't aware :</span> <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-style: italic;">that bikes can be dangerous for walkers</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><span _moz_dirty="" style="font-style: italic;"><br _moz_dirty=""/></span>						<br/></span></span>						<br/>						<br/>]]></description>

  <title>Wallonia 2007</title>
  <link>http://www.hejorama.com/chron-Wallonia-2007-130.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[																											<span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Wallonia 2007</span><br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>Every year, on the third week end of September is organized the "<span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">Wallonia Days</span>" (aka "Fetes de Wallonies"). <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">Wallonia</span> is the French part of the Belgium, in the south of the country.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>So for the second time we headed to <span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">Namur</span> (the capital city of Wallonia) to attend the "Wallonia Days". From Paris, it's only a 3h hours ride by car and in Belgium, all the road are toll free so it's pretty cheap to get there.<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>In Namur, we stayed at my friend Ben's aunt, so I can't give you good hostel addresses but I'm sure it's pretty easy to find on the Net. As we arrived around 11pm, we got in the party directly ! During this special week end, almost the whole city is dedicated only to pedestrians and basically, you drink beer and liquors all the night. So it quickly turns into a really fun night ! The typical wallon liquor is called&nbsp;<span _moz_dirty="" style="font-weight: bold;">Pequet</span> and is available in various flavour like watermelon, strawberry, coconut, you-name-it. As it's really sweet, you can get drunk in no time so be careful ! Of course, there's also a lot of Belgian beers which are really good. There's music everywhere and everybody is partying all night long in the streets. There's also live music band, especially during the day. During the day, there's a lot of cultural exhibitions, concert and traditionnal shows. Of course, there's also a lot to food everywhere, and you'd better have something to eat with all the liquors :) Try the "french fries", it's a belgian specialty !<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>We cruised all night long across the city socializing with belgian people, drinking, peeing and avoiding to get puked on... A really crazy night but I still can't remember everything ;)<br _moz_dirty=""/><br _moz_dirty=""/>I think it must be lot like the Oktoberfest in Munich but I haven't been there yet so I can't tell how much. I'll definitely be in Munich in october 2008 and of course in Namur in September :)												]]></description>
