			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/us/02bcculture.html?_r=1" target="_blank">this article in the New York Times</a> about a &#8220;Haunting Old Photographic process. It was a story about a current photographer who researched a photographic process called wet plate collodion. This photo process apparently was made famous during the Civil War by battlefield photographers. The San Francisco photographer wanted to learn this process so he could apply it for photos he was taking of current veterans that have returned home after serving in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The article showed a few photos of the process and described how it has gained a resurgence over the last year. I found this pretty interesting so I decided to dig a little deeper to learn more. I was able to find this video that shows each step of the detailed process to take these photographs.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gyf8fQOdvDs" frameborder="0" width="620" height="495"></iframe></p>
<div id="attachment_42840" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 357px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/alien_menu1.jpg" rel="lightbox[42827]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42840" style="margin: 5px;" title="alien_menu" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/alien_menu1.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="236" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alien Skin B&amp;W Filter settings</p></div>
<p>This looked very interesting to me and so I decided to keep looking a bit to see if I could find any ways to simulate this digitally in photoshop. I was able to find <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=X5yjCI-cOTgC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=wet+plate+photoshop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WovdN-PGzK&amp;sig=0pyGaJbCWoEH67POB7B_1YbAA_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x9BnTvO3C-nTiALYmrjmDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=wet%20plate%20photoshop&amp;f=false" target="_blank">this link</a> to the Photoshop fine art effects cookbook that provides a tutorial on how to manually create this effect in Photoshop. So that&#8217;s a great tutorial for creating the effect using a manual process within core Photoshop but dug a little deeper.</p>
<p>I then came across some <a href="http://www.gettotallyrad.com/products/photoshop-actions/" target="_blank">pre-built actions</a> for Photoshop by Totally Rad that creates a very similar effect which you can see <a href="http://www.gettotallyrad.com/blog/original-actions/old-skool-photoshop-action/" target="_blank">here</a>. These looked pretty interesting but then I also discovered Alien Skin&#8217;s Exposure 3. So I <a href="http://www.alienskin.com/exposure/index.aspx" target="_blank">downloaded the free trial</a> to test it out. It&#8217;s very simple to get an initial effect using their &#8220;B&amp;W &#8211; Vintage&#8221; filters which offer several varying Calotype presets with the ability to tweak the settings using color, focus, tone, grain, IR, and age. So I played around a bit and was able to get some pretty nice effects as you can see. I didn&#8217;t choose the most applicable photo, but you&#8217;ll get the point.</p>
<div id="attachment_42832" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Family_Untouched_sm.jpg" rel="lightbox[42827]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42832" title="Family_Untouched_sm" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Family_Untouched_sm.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="494" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Original Photo</p></div>
<div id="attachment_42833" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Family_Calotype_2_sm.jpg" rel="lightbox[42827]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42833" title="Family_Calotype_2_sm" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Family_Calotype_2_sm.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="494" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alien Skin - Calotype Sepia - Scratches &amp; Vignette Square (no edits)</p></div>
<div id="attachment_42834" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Family_Calotype_sm.jpg" rel="lightbox[42827]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42834" title="Family_Calotype_sm" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Family_Calotype_sm.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="494" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alien Skin - Calotype (with various custom modified settings by me)</p></div>
<p>As you can see the Alien Skin filters do a pretty nice job. In an age of <a href="http://instagr.am/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> I have become fascinated with filters and the various methods to modify photographs to try and get an artistic look from them. I&#8217;ve stated before that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" target="_blank">HDR</a> is the auto-tune of the photography world. I&#8217;m sure the purists are notably pissed by all these new wannabe photographers that are sprouting online nowadays but photo manipulation is fun and I only see it getting bigger.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can tell summer is over, not from the weather or the calendar but when my commute returns to the progressively worse effed up state it was in prior to summer. That&#8217;s not to say that summer offers much of a break from it, but even a 10% improvement is noticeable.</p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles and my commute includes what has been <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/toptens/worstbottlenecks.html" target="_blank">ranked as the #1 worst freeway bottleneck</a> in the whole nation. It&#8217;s amazing to me as a geek to watch the advancements in technology from my Atari 2600, as a kid to my first brush with a computer the Radio Shack TRS-80, to how online has changed from the single line BSS&#8217;s when I was a kid to where we are today.</p>
<p>How is it though that ground transportation hasn&#8217;t really gone anywhere in that same timeframe? It&#8217;s amazing how much of our lives are consumed moving from point A to point B nowadays at a speed that is even slower than it was 10 or 20 years ago. We&#8217;re actually going backwards.</p>
<p>The only saving grace to help with this antiquated non-innovative transportation issue are the technology innovations like, GPS, realtime traffic, and mobile phones which provide some comfort by letting us listen to podcasts or frikkin audio streams beamed over the air.</p>
<p>Being a geek I&#8217;m amazingly happy to have grown up during the emergence of computers and the web but I find this lack of innovation in transportation logistics or technology amazing and don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s going to improve anytime soon. I think what this all boils down to is that I&#8217;m pissed that <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/2010/07/six-ways-sci-fi-lied-2/" target="_blank">Back to the Future was a lie</a>. There&#8217;s no way in hell we&#8217;re going to have hover cars in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hover_car.jpg" rel="lightbox[42815]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42818 aligncenter" title="hover_car" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hover_car.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="277" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tummelvision-logo1.png" rel="lightbox[42801]"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42802" style="margin: 3px;" title="tummelvision-logo1" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tummelvision-logo1.png" alt="" width="137" height="158" /></a>A few weeks ago I was honored to be a guest on a podcast that I&#8217;ve been a listener of called Tummelvision. The podcast has 3 great hosts which include <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Kevin Marks</a>, <a href="http://www.deborahschultz.com/" target="_blank">Deborah Schultz</a>, and <a href="http://heathergold.com" target="_blank">Heather Gold</a>. Here&#8217;s the topic of the show in their words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tummelvision is a weekly salon-style podcast about the art and science  of engaging and collaborating in a networked age. Each week we explore  how to connect and create a world that puts people at the centre of  business, technology and culture with the smart folks creating this new  world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Each week they invite a guest from varied areas to discuss how they &#8220;tummel&#8221; and share other interesting information about their roles for work, personal projects or other areas. They have varied guests from different fields which make for an eclectic show that both stays fresh and offers interesting topics to learn about. The hosts always make for a very engaging discussion around the topics that surround the guests that often go on welcomed tangents that branch off to other areas surrounding their discussion. It&#8217;s definitely a source of delicious brain food that is fed in different tasty chunks each week. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>When I joined them we covered quite a few varied topics during the first half of the show including higher education, name spaces, and influence. The second part of the show I peel back the curtain to offer some insight to what we do at the X PRIZE foundation. You can visit their website and listen to my show <a href="http://tummelvision.tv/2011/04/29/tummelvision-63-mark-krynsky/" target="_blank">here</a> and subscribe to the podcast on iTunes <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=392538139" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After today&#8217;s announcement that <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aknpkdffaafgjchaibgeefbgmgeghloj?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Angry Birds was released in the Chrome app store</a> I just knew I had to try running it on my new Sharp 70&#8243; LCD TV (model <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/LCDTVs/LC70LE732U.aspx" target="_blank">LC-70LE732u</a>). I recorded a video to show this. Unfortunately even the HD version of Angry Birds doesn&#8217;t go full screen to take advantage of the full 1920&#215;1080 resolution of the TV. I think I may also now hold the distinction of being the first person to run this on such a large LCD TV.</p>
<p><iframe width="620" height="383" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lTQww7Vrvpw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Sharp is a great TV that costed less than every 65&#8243; LCD that was on the market when I purchased it and is fully LED backlit as opposed to most that are only LED edge lit. I&#8217;m really happy with it and highly recommend you research it if you&#8217;re in the market for a large LCD TV. <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=132565">Here&#8217;s a great thread on the very popular AVS Forum</a> if you want to learn more about it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mark_droid_charge_220.jpg" rel="lightbox[42775]"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42779" title="mark_droid_charge_220" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mark_droid_charge_220.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="315" /></a>My first smart phone was an iPhone 3G. While on AT&amp;T I was loaned a Nexus One (Google&#8217;s Android phone) and tested it out to get my first chance to compare Android to iOS. As I <a href="http://krynsky.com/deciding-to-switch-to-the-verizon-iphone-is-not-a-black-and-white-decision/">wrote about this previously</a>, I felt that Android still has some catching up to do before it provides the same seamless experience. I finally decided to upgrade to a new phone when moving to Verizon&#8217;s network earlier this year. I struggled on whether to get an iPhone 4 or wait for the upcoming crop of Android phones on Verizon&#8217;s LTE network. Well I couldn&#8217;t wait so ended up getting the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>This week I was given the opportunity to test out the new Samsung Droid Charge [<em>Disclosure: I'm being given one to keep</em>] which is their first entry on Verizon&#8217;s LTE (4g) network. I was very excited to read this <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/droid-charge-review-04150062/" target="_blank">favorable review over at Slashgear</a> on the day I was to pick it up. When I finally got one in my hands the first impression that smacks you on the head is the beautiful 4.3&#8243; Super AMOLED Plus display which is the same one they use on their <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/28/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-review/" target="_blank">new Galaxy S II</a>. I know that this is either a plus or minus depending on personal needs, but this is my biggest complaint with the iPhone. How could Apple double the resolution of the iPhone&#8217;s display and not increase the screen size? It&#8217;s not just about having some more real estate, but I have some big hands and I can type much more comfortable on the Samsung. The image produced by the display is stunning and viewing photos and videos are gorgeous on it.</p>
<div id="attachment_42776" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3G_vs_4G_vs_Wifi_620.jpg" rel="lightbox[42775]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42776 " title="3G_vs_4G_vs_Wifi_620" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3G_vs_4G_vs_Wifi_620.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="311" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My iPhone connected to 3g vs. Samsung Droid Charge hotspot on LTE (4g) vs. Wifi on my Time Warner Cable</p></div>
<p>The next biggest feature difference on the Samsung vs. my iPhone is LTE. In the short time I&#8217;ve been able to test it thus far I can tell you that the speed is nothing short of awesome. It reminds me of the first time I upgraded from DSL to Cable. The speed at which apps that connect to the network and the browser operates is addictingly fast. Not only do you get that speed out of the phone, but you can also create a mobile hotspot to share that fat pipe or even tether to your computer to tap it. I get impatient now and it feels so slow when I revert back to the iPhone. The iPhone 5 better offer 4G on either AT&amp;T or Verizon because it will be a huge handicap and seem antiquated out of the box without it.</p>
<p>I feel that the Samsung Droid Charge&#8217;s screen size and speed on Verizon&#8217;s LTE network are the 2 major standout features when comparing this to my iPhone without even getting into any of the Android vs. iOS differences. I feel these 2 issues require serious merit in general if considering a new phone on Verizon or anyone else&#8217;s network for that matter. Beyond those two clear distinctions I&#8217;m also re-evaluating Android from my last experience with the Nexus one. Unfortunately the phone is running Android 2.2 Froyo and not the newer 2.3 Gingerbread. I do like the Samsung TouchWiz UI which doesn&#8217;t get in the way and works better than the app scrolling on the Nexus. The built-in cameras (both front and rear facing) seem pretty good although I haven&#8217;t A/B&#8217;d them to the iPhone. I also like all the built in photo effects available natively in the OS, especially the panorama mode (see below). Another huge plus is the native android ability to share photos from the camera app or gallery to other apps like Twitter, Facebook, Picplz, Seesmic, Tweetdeck and others. I wish that iOS had this feature. The other feature I need to investigate more is <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/allshare/pcsw/" target="_blank">AllShare</a> which on the surface seems like Android&#8217;s answer to iOS&#8217;s Airplay.</p>
<p><a title="Sweet built in panorama mode on the Samsung Droid Charge #Droidchargederby by krynsky, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/krynsky/5691505903/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5063/5691505903_5764cac0fa_z.jpg" alt="Sweet built in panorama mode on the Samsung Droid Charge #Droidchargederby" width="640" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>One of the biggest concerns having both the 4.3&#8243; display and using the LTE network is battery life. Since I&#8217;ve only had the phone for 2 days I don&#8217;t have enough experience to comment much on this except that I haven&#8217;t noticed it to be terrible. Day one I ran out at the end of the day and on day two I still had 26% left at midnight but in both cases my usage was moderate and didn&#8217;t involve heavy usage of the mobile hotspot which I&#8217;ve read is a battery killer.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more info on battery life from the Slashgear review</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having seen the HTC ThunderBolt chew through a full charge in short order, we were more than a little nervous about the DROID Charge’s appetite. Happily it seems Samsung has managed to balance performance and power – impressive given the size and brightness of the Super AMOLED Plus display – with us managing 6-8 hours of heavy use before it died. With more casual use, and some tweaking of things like social network updates and other power settings, you could comfortably get through a day. Still, using the Mobile Hotspot app for any length of time chews through the battery in relatively short order.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I still have some more testing to do and need to see if some of the Android issues that have bothered me in the past have been improved or overcome but overall I&#8217;ve been very happy with this phone. My goal will be to see if I can upgrade my Verizon plan to add LTE and Hotpotting so that it can support my usage of both the iPhone and Samsung Droid Charge simultaneously on one plan. That way I can switch between both phones as my daily usage dictates. We&#8217;ll see if that&#8217;s possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Today I <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2011/03/what-tools-do-startups-use-lis.php" target="_blank">saw a post at ReadWriteWeb</a> about a Wiki started by Songkick&#8217;s Ian Hogarth so that startups could collectively share tools and resources used to run their companies. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://startuptools.pbworks.com/w/page/17974963/FrontPage" target="_blank">link to the Wiki</a> which is a good resource, but I once had a vision of something grander along these lines. I have actually given this quite a bit of thought in the past and even had a startup idea to actually create a website where companies could create profiles to share knowledge of web tools, services, methodologies and more, to collectively help one another. How meta right? When thinking this through further I had concerns about whether companies would actually be willing to interact and participate in sharing this knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>From the Read Write Web Post</strong> (re: the Wiki)</p>
<blockquote><p>That advice and openness makes this a valuable resource for startups, so they can focus on building their product and not get sidetracked on questions like &#8220;Does anyone recommend a CRM?&#8221; As Hogarth argues, &#8220;I&#8217;m a big believer of trying to focus on your core competency (in our case tour dates) and then partnering with the best class companies elsewhere.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Primarily regarding web tools and services, it can be a pretty painstaking process to research and find the right one. In my work for <a href="http://xprize.org" target="_blank">X PRIZE Foundation</a> I have to not only find great tools and services, but also have to consider many free, open source, or low cost tools. We are a non-profit so I do my best to try and limit the budget we allocate to these so I can put it to better uses. Recently I joined a really interesting service called <a href="http://bagcheck.com" target="_blank">BagCheck</a> which is a community to share and discover interesting and detailed lists of items around a given topic. In testing out the site I create a &#8220;Bag&#8221; called <a href="http://bagcheck.com/bag/3302-great-web-services-to-help-run-your-business" target="_blank">Great Web Services to Help Run Your Business</a>. In it I provide a list of many of the tools and services I use at X PRIZE. So basically my vision would be to have a site dedicated to this specific niche where companies, startups, nonprofits and even freelancers could collectively share their knowledge so that we could make tool and service discovery a much easier process. Perhaps I should rekindle this startup idea&#8230;if only I had the time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_38892" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/sxsw.jpg" rel="lightbox[38877]"><img class="size-full wp-image-38892" title="sxsw" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/sxsw.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="374" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My SXSW App Group</p></div>
<p>Here we are on the eve of SXSW and I&#8217;ve seen several posts and comments across the social web from people with negative commentary on the conference. Strangely enough quite a bit of it coming from people that are still going despite the mudslinging. Really if it&#8217;s such a bad atmosphere then why even go? Many of these people make excuses stating they _have_ to be there despite their reluctance.</p>
<p>It seems that last year sparked a &#8220;jump the shark&#8221; moment for the conference for many people. The conference has grown and in much the same way an indie band with a following gets dumped by many of their original fans upon penetrating the mainstream, many SXSW OG Geeks are now acting the same way. Sure I understand that last year the parties were overcrowded tons of people and most regulars felt overrun by the mainstreamers, douchebags, and the like, but SXSW is just a victim of its own success.</p>
<p>This will be my 3rd year attending SXSW and I&#8217;m approaching it with just as much excitement as I have in previous years. Why? Because it provides me with the best opportunity to spend time with all the great people I&#8217;ve built relationships with online and discover new ones. My primary goal is to learn from these people, share knowledge, and have fun along the way. Also each year I&#8217;ve met many new great people that I&#8217;ve continued relationships with long after the show. Sure SXSW was much larger last year, but I adjusted. I didn&#8217;t go to as many parties and spend as much time at them either. The larger parties are usually so loud that you can&#8217;t really hold good conversations anyways which is my main goal.</p>
<p>Each year SXSW becomes a proving ground for a startup to emerge as a one week beta test to emerge with a concept that is met with the crowd&#8217;s love and approval. The fact is this years&#8217; conference anticipated attendance is much bigger than last year and will prove challenging. So how are the old timers responding? Well it appears that group texting has gained the buzz mindshare as being the breakout mobile app category this year. Why? Because as a preemptive strike people are creating small groups in these apps so that they can quickly communicate to organize meetups to avoid, or as a backup plan to overcrowded parties. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll also be a good way to have an elite back-channel to the conference as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m looking forward to going and hope that spend time with as many great people as possible while I&#8217;m there. You can stalk me so that we can spend time together using one of the links below:</p>

<p>Last week my friend and co-worker <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hooverd" target="_blank">David Locke</a> who is a foodie and connoisseur introduced me to an old school cocktail called the &#8220;Old Fashioned&#8221;. I quickly fell in love with this simple and tasty drink. Tonight I went out to get the ingredients to make myself one and while not quite as tasty as the one I had for the first time over at <a href="http://www.beechwoodrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Beechwood</a>, it still didn&#8217;t disappoint. In doing some research there <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=connosieur#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;q=bourbon+old+fashioned+cocktail&amp;aq=1&amp;aqi=g2g-m3&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=dded8f20a6bb9442" target="_blank">are several tiny variations</a> on how to make it. You can get some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned" target="_blank">history on the drink over at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/iphone_switch.jpg" rel="lightbox[34451]"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-34462" style="margin: 3px;" title="iphone_switch" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/iphone_switch.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="236" /></a>In anticipation of tomorrow&#8217;s announcement of the iPhone finally making it&#8217;s way to the Verizon network the inevitable barrage of blog posts analyzing why you should or shouldn&#8217;t switch are starting to make the rounds. Gizmodo has flat out said &#8220;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5729273/dont-buy-the-verizon-iphone-4" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t buy the Verizon iPhone</a>&#8220;  and Zack Epstein of the Boy Genius Report states &#8220;<a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/01/10/why-im-not-switching-to-the-verizon-iphone/" target="_blank">Why I’m not switching to the Verizon iPhone: Need for speed</a>&#8220;. While many of these posts will proclaim the correct decision one way or the other, it&#8217;s not going to be that cut and dry.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my case for probable switching, but everyone has different circumstances in which they need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves. I currently own an iPhone 3G which is currently unusable with the latest iOS 4.2. My contract with AT&amp;T expired 3 months ago and my son&#8217;s contract as an added line just expired last month. So I currently have no contractual obligations to stay with AT&amp;T. If I did that would force me to think hard about what I&#8217;m willing to pay to leave AT&amp;T and depending on how many lines you have it could get really expensive to do that. If I was still bound to a lengthy term I would most likely ride it out and wait to see how the iPhone fairs on Verizon&#8217;s network. Now in my case I decided to wait for both what was announced at CES as well as the fact that all my contracts would be up right now and there would likely be an iPhone announcement on Verizon.</p>
<p>I was considering getting an Android but I was lucky enough to have a friend let me borrow their Nexus One for a while so that I could get a feel for the OS. I recorded a Cinchcast that summed up my experience (see below) and while I think there are some great things about the Android OS I personally feel the iPhone still provides an overall better experience. The announcement of Verizon 4G LTE Android sets were pretty exciting at CES but the way I see it is that I will purchase an iPhone and wait for these new devices to be released an mature a bit so they can get the kinks out. I&#8217;m guessing the second generation of these will be really nice.</p>
<p><object id="145709" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="300" height="200" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="name" value="145709" /><param name="flashvars" value="file=http:%2f%2fwww.cinchcast.com%2fCinchPlaylist.aspx%3FRecordingID%3D145709&amp;playermode=text&amp;autostart=false&amp;bufferlength=5&amp;volume=80&amp;callback=http://www.cinchcast.com/FlashPlayerCallback.aspx&amp;width=300&amp;height=200&amp;volume=80&amp;corner=rounded" /><param name="src" value="http://www.cinchcast.com/cinchplayerext.swf" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><embed id="145709" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="300" height="200" src="http://www.cinchcast.com/cinchplayerext.swf" quality="high" wmode="transparent" flashvars="file=http:%2f%2fwww.cinchcast.com%2fCinchPlaylist.aspx%3FRecordingID%3D145709&amp;playermode=text&amp;autostart=false&amp;bufferlength=5&amp;volume=80&amp;callback=http://www.cinchcast.com/FlashPlayerCallback.aspx&amp;width=300&amp;height=200&amp;volume=80&amp;corner=rounded" name="145709"></embed></object></p>
<p>I need a new phone now and the way I see it the iPhone is my current favorite. Another benefit for me is that I will most likely purchase the iPhone and then if I decide to switch to Android I can either wait until my 2 year contract is up or can switch earlier by selling my iPhone which will likely retain it&#8217;s value very well and then probably get a great price on one of the many used Android handsets that will be available. In fact I might even get a used Android to play with on Verizon as well. The rumor is that Verizon will offer an unlimited data plan while on AT&amp;T there is a cap. But the flipside to that is that reports are that AT&amp;T 3G speeds are faster than Verizon so you have to weigh that as well. The final kicker is that I have quite a few friends and family already on Verizon that are currently costing me minutes on AT&amp;T that will no longer be the case when I switch to Verizon. This is another benefit to consider.</p>
<p>If I already had an iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T and locked into a contract for the foreseeable future I&#8217;d just ride it out and wait to see what happens when the barrage of people start jumping on the Verizon network to hear their feedback and make sure the network doesn&#8217;t implode under the new usage. But I&#8217;m in LA and reception here while not great isn&#8217;t as bad as cities like San Francisco or New York. So location may be another swaying factor. Anyways these are some of my thoughts so take your time and make the best decision based on all the factors.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_34311" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ces_2011.jpg" rel="lightbox[34245]"><img class="size-full wp-image-34311 " style="margin: 2px;" title="ces_2011" src="http://krynsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ces_2011.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">image courtesy of Flickr user Jaymi Heimbuch</p></div>
<p>Last year I had a great time returning to CES after a really long absence. This year I couldn&#8217;t make it but luckily the coverage has been amazing and I almost feel as if I was there (minus hanging out with so many of my geek friends). Sure you probably heard about all the Android Tablets, Verizon&#8217;s 4G LTE stuff and other high profile announcements but I wanted to highlight a few things that I really liked that you may or may not have heard about.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Demise of Cable Set Top Boxes</strong></p>
<p>I was really excited when I heard several stories coming out of CES about partnerships between cable companies and hardware manufacturers to start allowing their content to be delivered directly to their devices. It appears that Time Warner will offer this soon to both <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/05/time-warner-cable-vod-coming-to-sony-bravia-hdtvs-sans-the-cabl/" target="_blank">Sony</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/06/samsung-teams-up-to-access-tv-vod-from-time-warner-and-comcast-on/" target="_blank">Samsung</a> devices. What&#8217;s even better is that it looks like there will also be support to get cable access on iPads and Android tablets. The Samsung TV&#8217;s that will have support are the D8000 series of which the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5724992/samsungs-new-tvs-3d-and-skinny" target="_blank">UN65D8000</a> is the model I&#8217;m dreaming of. I&#8217;m so looking forward to consolidating hardware wherever possible in my home theater setup. On the Sony front my dream would be to use my PS3 to access Time Warner as well as use it as a DVR but no details of that type of functionality have been made available yet. Currently you can <a href="http://www.att.com/u-verse/explore/xbox-receiver.jsp#fbid=b2jnTXyrUtN" target="_blank">use an Xbox 360 to as a set top</a> box for AT&amp;T&#8217;s uVerse and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vh5eNcXrM0" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a video demo</a>. Engadget did a nice writeup <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/09/could-this-be-the-year-we-get-to-ditch-the-cable-box/" target="_blank">asking whether this is the year we ditch the cable box</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Streaming Your Media to iOS, Android Devices, Game Consoles, and the Web</strong></p>
<p>Streaming your media to the web and other hardware devices has been around for a while but usually it takes quite a bit of work to set it up, it doesn&#8217;t always work right and usually only limited devices were supported. Also, there hadn&#8217;t really been a good solution for mobile devices. That&#8217;s all starting to change. I&#8217;ve recently started using <a href="http://www.libox.com/" target="_blank">Libox</a> which streams my media to my iPad via an app as well as the web.  Another similar one I haven&#8217;t tried yet is <a href="http://www.zumocast.com/" target="_blank">ZumoCast</a>. You may be familiar with <a href="http://new.orb.com" target="_blank">Orb Networks</a> which already has a service that streams your media to iPhone, Android, the web, and a $99 hardware device. Well at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/orb-br-software-comes-to-ps3-and-other-blu-ray-players-1080p-st/" target="_blank">CES they announced</a> they will now release support for the PS3 and other Blue-Ray players with an app for $20. With all the different media devices out there I have yet to find anything that can match the power and flexibility of a PS3 with <a href="http://www.playon.tv/playon" target="_blank">PlayOn</a> and <a href="http://ps3mediaserver.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">PS3 Media Server</a>. Now by adding Orb or one of these other mobile device apps I truly can access my media anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>3. Mobile Devices Becoming Smart Remotes</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of the Logitech Harmony universal remotes over the last several years. You can use your computer to program these using macros to have simplify the setup of multiple devices in your home theater for different viewing activities. But now these dedicated devices that are costly to the point of reaching iPod touch pricing aren&#8217;t making much sense to buy. Especially since you can do so much more with mobile devices. I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5709968/the-best-remote-apps-for-your-iphone" target="_blank">keeping my eye on the development</a> of hardware and apps to offer universal remote features for the iPhone but they haven&#8217;t yet gotten great. Well at CES popular accessory maker Griffin announced a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/griffins-beacon-universal-remote-control-system-brings-dongle-f/" target="_blank">dongle free universal remote solution and app for iOS devices for $79</a>. This sounds like it may finally be the universal remote device we&#8217;ve been waiting for. I also hope to see such developments on the Android platform as well.</p>
<p><strong>4. Analytics Tracking for our Bodies</strong></p>
<p>At CES Nike announced their new <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/07/nike-sportwatch-gps" target="_blank">Nike+ Sportwatch GPS device</a> that will record your running pace, distance route, heart rate, and calories burned. You can then upload the data to the nikeplus.com site to generate a history of your workouts. There are other devices in this area that can track our workouts. Some of the more popular ones are the <a href="http://www.withings.com/" target="_blank">Withings</a> wi-fi body scale, <a href="http://runkeeper.com/" target="_blank">Runkeeper</a> fitness tracker, <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a> fitness &amp; sleep tracker. These are just some of the devices out there marking the start of many new ones we&#8217;ll continue to see being released in the near future to provide ways for <a href="http://krynsky.com/the-emergence-of-lifelogging-and-the-quantified-self/" target="_blank">lifelogging</a> various aspects of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>5. Smart Home Automation for Mobile Devices and the Web</strong></p>
<p>I always keep my eye on developments in this area, hoping with excitement that I&#8217;ll soon see something cool announced when reading the <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/" target="_blank">eHomeUpgrade blog</a>, I continue to wait. While nothing magical was announced at CES this year, there are some signs that things are starting to ramp up in this area. I was listening to TWIT interview someone from GE that was talking about many of the new technologies they were showing at CES. He discussed <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110106005914/en/GE-Technology-Empower-Connected-Home-Future-Unveiled" target="_blank">smart meters you can put in the home to monitor power usage</a> and other functions. There was also a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/homeseer-hometroller-mini-home-automation-controller-gets-you-on" target="_blank">home automation device from HomeSeer</a> to control your thermostat, appliances, lights, and window shades. Then also in keeping with the pattern of wanting more functionality in my mobile devices there were announcements from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/08/somfy-tahoma-z-wave-and-rts-home-automation-gateway-hands-on/" target="_blank">Somfy</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/hands-on-with-verizons-home-control/" target="_blank">Verizon</a> showing home automation controls that can be done on an iPad as well as the web. I&#8217;m telling you pretty soon we will be running everything in our house with a tablet.</p>
<p><strong>6. [Bonus] The iPad iCade</strong></p>
<p>I remember last April Fool&#8217;s day drooling over this gag product on ThinkGeek thinking OMG I would actually buy one of those. Well our dreams have come true. ThinkGeek must have gotten some huge response from it because they were <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5727939/hands+on-with-the-ion-audio-icade-buttons-fit-for-mashing" target="_blank">showing the iPad iCade at CES</a>. I can&#8217;t wait to get more info on this and I&#8217;m pretty damn sure my $99 bucks will be rushed to them as soon as this thing comes out.</p>
